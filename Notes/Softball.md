I want to share something. For those of you that don't know, I probably shared too much. I'm a proud dad. My daughter just started high school, I'm proud to say she's such a good kid. I really mean, I'm not just saying that because she's mine, but still freaks me out. And she went from this tiny little school of 36 kids in her entire grade to now there's 650 kids in her grade. So big ship, she wanted to go to this public high school because she wants to pitch they have a really good softball team. 

So she decided to go to this high school. And here's the cool part I catch for my daughter. So she has a pitching coach, who comes twice a week. And yeah, I catch for which is amazing, except now I'm scared because she's 14 My height and she's throwing a ball. I don't know if anybody plays softball or watch girls softball, yes. She pitches it's not super fast. For her age. It's in the top bracket. She pitches about 52 miles an hour at 42 feet. When they go in the dirt. I'm like, literally my adrenaline I almost vomit. Like, you know, the short hops if you ever watch baseball, and six months ago, she broke my toe. I missed the ball at the end of my toast snap. 

So yeah, it's fun. Fun times. I'm literally like, I realized I'm like three months away that I just can't, I don't know if I can catch for. So I'm telling you this, because my daughter has pinched on and off for five years. And like go with a trainer kind of love it. And then she's like, Dad, it's too much pressure. I just want to play outfield. She's really good at left field. She has good arm, she hits good. She can play outfield, and then she wants to pitch and then she's not sure she's like, it's so much responsibility. What if I let the team down? Pitching if you watch girls softball, there's a lot to it different than like, I believe way harder than overhand for boys. 

I really do. I watch what she had to go through. So why am I saying this? Because I watched her go on and off this summer, she made a decision Dad, I'm going to be the best outfielder, I don't want the the pressure of pitching. So there was a couple of things I shared with what I've been sharing with my daughter and I shared this with you guys is you win games when no one is watching. Right? 

That responsibility of winning or losing the game is so amazing. If you're ready for it, like but you don't win when you're on the field, you win when you're in the backyard throwing 100 pitches or 200 pitches a night when no one's there. And when it's really hot, when no one is applauding for you. What you how you win in private and public is what we do in private. That's simply it. You want to take your business to the next level, and you show up here but you actually don't do the work between when we're together. It's kind of on you just being honest. It's kind of on you. You buy the course but you only go through a half of it. And you say it didn't work for me. It's kinda on you. Right? You get to the game and you can't throw a strike. But you miss three practices to my daughter. It's kind of unusual. It's not a bad day. You're not tired. You're not a bad mood. You didn't freakin put the work in, right? 

So why am I telling you this? Probably three months ago, I did about four things with my daughter to get in her mind, not to manipulate, but for her to identify what was important to her for her to find an inner strength. Because if we can learn to do the practice in softball when no one's watching, we can learn to do that in business in life and relationships. I feel really blessed. This is not bragging, I'm married to the love of my life. Our relationship gets stronger every day, not by accident. I do a lot of work when no one's watching, because I've messed up on relationships in the past. 

Maybe I'm the only one but I have been honest. But I'm not messing up on this one. And I put the work in when no one's watching people look at us all the time and go, Oh my God, you two are so cute. And you're so lucky you fell in love. It's not luck. We both do the work. Right? So about three or four months ago. I just gotten my daughter's ear not to manipulate her not to force her to do anything but to commit and decide if you want to be the best outfielder, let's go all in on outfield. But I got her in a place where she made the decision said I want to give it one last try. Can I get a coach twice a week? And will you catch for me I committed to catch for no matter what when it's four o'clock Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm catching for my daughter. 

And I watched a shift in her mindset. Three months ago, go from dabbling one foot out to literally burning the boats. Four months ago, the coach said this and he's the sweetest man I've ever met. He's such a good coach. And he said, You know what she could play at high school level she could about four months ago. yesterday. She was throwing such fire and a curveball and a drop ball and a rise ball and a changeup. She crushed it so hard in practice yesterday he looked at me and he said she's my number one student I've never seen anybody change in my entire life because she's going to start all through high school. And if she wants to play in college, she's got everything she needs. 

So what the hell happened in three months? What changed from a girl who pitched on and off for five years to something changing and snapping and making a difference? There was four things I taught her. 

Honest and truly who would like those four things? How would you like who'd like me to share those four things with you? Okay. What did I just share with you guys? A story. 

I just shared a story. 
How important do you think storytelling is for your business, no matter what you're in, on a scale of one to 10? How important storytelling. So let me ask you a couple other things. Did you guys like the story? Yes or No? Was it super fancy? Did I tell the story like a perfect storyteller. And I just kind of tell you about my daughter, by the way, 100% of what I shared is true. Now, one thing was variation. So it was easy to tell. So it was the story. It was a great story, right? It's a true story. Let me ask you a really important question. Did any of you feel like I was selling you? Or just telling you a story about my daughter? Did anyone feel that I was selling you? But if I said, for 97 bucks, I'll tell you those four secrets for you, your friends, your family? Who would pay the 97 bucks, I got nothing for sale. I'm not selling it. Just saying. 

So how important is storytelling? How important is storytelling if I was selling you? Or how important is it if I was just teaching you? See if I just said to you, hey guys, I have the four methods. And the four methods to make anyone in your life even a teenager, step up and make a difference and go all in would you like to hear like, oh, that sounds pretty cool. Maybe, maybe not. But I told you a story. I got you totally emotionally invested in the story. I told you an honest story. I told you a story where there really was four or five things that I did to anchor her and go all in I future pace for what it would look like being in 12th grade, and all of her friends showing up for the championship game. I let her vision four years from now that if she put the practice in, in practice three or four days a week, and she went and she started and in ninth grade, she's probably not going to start 10th grade she starts on JV 11th grade she's maybe since the bench sometimes Farsi by 12th grade, she's playing every single game and she's there for the championship game. 

I said, How cool would that be? Your girlfriend's sitting on the stands cheering for you, and it's on you and you're ready for that responsibility. You want to take ownership the game is in your hands, you bring the championship home or you fail. That's a lot of responsibility. But it's the best in the frickin world. How would you like that? And I future paced her. 

I have chills thinking about it. I let her visualize that. And she's like, hell yes. Right. So I did things like that with her. Right? 

How valuable is that, but that story, set it up to where you just want who wanted to hear that? Just one little future pace thing I did with her. I'm sharing that with you. Because so many of you. Hopefully most of you are in the in the digital, digital product business. But whatever business you're in, how important is storytelling on a one to 10? 

If you have that feeling Damn, what did Dean do with his daughter? That's all you need to make a sale or get people to go. I'm pulling out my pen. Let me up. So today, I want to talk about the power of stories. This applies to everyone. No matter what business you're in. This applies if you're selling cars, fixing houses, doing hair, all of it's the same about storytelling, right? But I want you to really think through this. I told you a story about my daughter Correct? Did I tell you what year she was born? Or how she was like when she was two years old? Or what my relationship was with her mom? Or that I got a divorce. Like I can tell you all this stuff. I can also tell you when she didn't get her homework done. I can also tell you she pisses me off every week when she leaves her house every morning without cleaning her room. How many times do I have to ask her to make her freakin bed? Like, are you freaking kidding me? Right? I can tell you all that. But it had nothing to do with the end result. 

The end result was I was either going to sell you or teach you the four things to get her to commit to being the best she could be. 

2.
So one of the biggest problems with stories I want you to write this down, is you tell your whole story. When you only need a scene out of your life that sets up what you want to sell or teach so many times I'll see on the internet, people doing their marketing and I watch their video. It's like I don't need the whole Story, don't need to know where you were born, or why your dad wasn't nice to you or your Mom Never Told You love you, that could be relevant, if that's what you're doing. But if you're selling, like, how to ski better, like, I don't even know all that I need to know how you sucked at skiing, there was a epiphany. And now you're the best skier in the world.

Teach me to ski. Don't care about your third divorce like, but if you're teaching someone how to be empowered on the other side of your third divorce, then I need to hear that scene. So I want you to think through the lens of what is the scene in that story in your life, it should show why you are qualified to teach it in that short little story. Did you look at me as qualified to get a teenage girl to go all in? Did you yes or no? Did you guys say? Well, Dean's got something to get a teenage girl to go all in right? 

Now. Here's where our brains mess with us. You guys ready for this? When you think of the word, why am I qualified? You start thinking oh, I'm not a child psychologist. I'm not a therapist. It's not what I do for a living. Did you guys give a crap that I'm not a therapist? Do you care that I this is not what I went to college for. I got a 14 year old girl with boys on her mind school on her mind. 600 kids in your grade not 40 finding new friends scared still to go to lunch because the seniors want to throw you out of the lunchroom. She's figuring all this stuff out. Hormones grew six inches in the last 18 months. I got that girl to go all in on pitching. Not an easy task. So does anybody care that I'm not an expert in this field, you have to remind yourself when I do this, no, I got the result. 

I got the goods, I got the treasure map, I have the recipe, all we're doing is shortening the learning curve. Right? We're just shortening the learning curve. 

So does your story position you were you can think someone can say, Wow, I understand that moment in their life. And that resulted in them to having the keys to the kingdom, they got something that can get me there faster. 

Now the other thing too, is you don't need to know everything. I'm not in this particular story. I'm not telling you how to help 14 year old girls wait till they're 18 years old before they date. I'm not teaching you that I'm not teaching you how to help them emotionally when their friends are half of them are freaking out and half of them are teaching you that. Like there's a million things about a 14 year old girl that I did not tell you about. I took one specific swimming link, how do you get a 14 year old girl to commit to something with all the chaos going around her so she can be the best version of herself, while simultaneously learning how to go all in and do what needs to be done when no one's watching. 

That's the only thing I'm teaching. 
So if you look through that your confidence goes up because you're not teaching everything. 

3.
Number three is when you have a story, you know, we talked about in the marketing side if you're part of any my programs, hook story close. Right? Always try to start your story that really gets people to go. Alright, I'm gonna listen to this. Right? What do you remember when I started? I didn't even do it on purpose. I was like, I told a little bit like, yeah, I have a 14 year old daughter that just started in high school in this big school. Right? I said something beating, Everybody raised their hand. You can imagine even if you don't have kids, or it's been a while you're like, Oh, I remember that or had a niece or a friend or my little brother, right? You immediately go in that spot. But I got this girl to do the work when no one's watching. And she's going to start and play all the way through high school and maybe college. I got her to commit who'd like to know how I did it. Right? 

You're like, I want to know that. Right? So how do you start off your story in a way where you go? Oh, damn, I want to hear this. Right. And I also said, and I didn't do this on purpose. I also said, I know it's a story about me, but I promise it'll relate back to you. 

So what is the first couple sentences? What is the first part of your story? That makes it intriguing? 

Right, if I would have said, If I would have started like, you know, being a dad is really special. I had this really beautiful young girl and if I went down that road, you'd be like, dude, what do you what are you getting that? I wanted to say? We're like, Oh, I wonder how the hell you did that. So when you start your story, you want someone in their head to go that helps you do that. 

In marketing, sometimes people call that an open loop. What's an open loop? You say something where you go, I need the answer to this one. I need the answer. How the hell did he do that? How did how did Rima pull that off? Right? Like that's, that's what we want to do in the first part of the story. 

4.
Number four is, this is a tough one. No, not really. Choose if you want to write this down, choose authenticity. over perfection. Choose authenticity over perfection. So many times we'll wait. Man, I have a story, but I don't know if I'm a good storyteller. Dean, so animated. He really brings you in. Do you know when a story is best, when you don't even realize you're telling a story? Right? Story is the best when like, you go to your favorite restaurant, and they blow your mind. They bring you out some food that's so spectacular. It explodes your your taste buds, you know, and the experience was amazing. And your waitress loved you. And the temperature was perfect. And the view was good. Do you ever tell your friend about that story? Like oh my god, you get done telling the story or whatever it is that you're passionate about. You didn't even know you were selling her. You didn't even know you got her to watch the movie. Go to the restaurant, read the book, make new friends start the new workout routine. Who in here has ever sold a friend on a certain way to eat? Be honest? Who here has ever sold their friend on a certain exercise? Who in here has ever sold a friend on watching a movie reading a book?
