# Pianificando in base ai tuoi livelli di energia


This 20 minute exercise could completely change your life

You’ve scheduled your day down to the minute, and it looks perfect, but around 2 o’clock, you don’t have any motivation to do “2 PM-Do taxes.” Don’t worry. You didn’t fail your schedule. Your schedule failed you! Take our 20-minute exercise to learn how you can maximize your efficiency by scheduling around your energy levels.

# Manage your energy levels
Virtual First | Well-being Kit

Most of us plan our days around _tasks_. But research suggests that planning our days around _energy levels_—when we’re feeling motivated vs. drained—is more effective. Use this exercise to become more aware of your energy patterns and build a schedule that fits your rhythm.

20 MINS | PERSONAL EXERCISE

Learn how to sustain motivation by designing the day around your energy levels—not just your tasks. Learn more in the [Virtual First Toolkit](https://experience.dropbox.com/virtual-first-toolkit/wellbeing/manage-your-energy-levels).


## Step 1: Map your energy levels 

Reflect on how your mental energy waxes and wanes throughout the day:
-  My energy is highest when ...
-  My energy drags when ...
-  My best ideas happen when ...
-  I lose my focus when ...

  

## Step 2: Build your energy rituals

Learn below how to shift an energy buster into an energy-boosting ritual. 

- **My energy busters**
   _A question to discover what lowers your energy_.
	- **My energy rituals**
	  _A small, concrete thing you can do to shift the pattern?_ 

- What’s an activity that drains your energy? 
  ex: _A two-hour block of meetings e__very_ _Monday__._ 
	- ex: _Build a_ **_playtime_** _ritual__—g__o outside and look at the clouds, or turn on the radio and dance for_ _two_ _min__ute__s._

- When during the day do you tend to need a break? 
  ex: _My energy drags after lunch._ 
	- ex: _Take a_ **_break._**_walk around the block or listen to your favorite podcast._

- What distracts you most during the day?
  ex: _Constant email pings._
	- ex: _Check your email_ **_just twice_** _a_ _day—at 10__:00_ _am and 2:30_ _pm__—and let your teammates know they can reach you_ _via_ _text or chat for emergencies._

- What’s another energy buster you’d like to address?
  ex: _I tend to work straight through lunch then get hangry at 3__:00_ _pm._ 
	- ex: _Add a proper_ **_lunch_****_time_** _to your calendar._



## Step 3: Design a high-energy day

Open your calendar and make some changes:

-   Block out time for can’t miss meetings.
-   Block out time for complex tasks (such as brainstorming, writing, coding) during times when you tend to have high energy.
-   Block out time for rote tasks (such as emails, scheduling, formatting) during times when you tend to have low energy.
-   What are your top three energy rituals? Add them to your calendar.
