# Mente milionaria
Per diventare milionario servi agli altri qualcosa di valore. Qualcosa che risolva un loro problema.

Tante ottime invenzioni nascono per soddisfare problemi comuni: anziché subire un problema, domandati come puoi risolverlo. Appunto perché tu percepisci quel problema hai molto da dire.

## Millionaire Mind Actions
Ogni volta che ti sorprendi a ==incolpare, giustificare o lamentarti==, fai scorrere il dito indice sul collo, come grilletto (trigger) per ricordare a te stesso che ti stai tagliando la gola finanziaria. 

--
2. Do a “debrief.” At the end of each day, write down one thing that went well and one thing that didn’t. Then write the answer to the following question: “How did I create each of these situations?” If others were involved, ask yourself, “What was my part in creating each of these situations?” This exercise will keep you accountable for your life and make you aware of the strategies that are working for you and the strategies that are not.

--
1. Write down two financial objectives that demonstrate your intention to create abundance, not mediocrity or poverty. Write “play to win” goals for your:
a. Annual income
b. Net worth
Make these goals achievable with a realistic time frame, yet at the same time remember to “shoot for the stars.”

--
2. Go to an upscale restaurant and order a meal at “market price” without asking how much it costs. (If funds are tight, sharing is acceptable.)
P.S. No chicken!

--
1. Write a short paragraph on exactly why creating wealth is important to you. Be specific.

--
2. Meet with a friend or family member who is willing to support you. Tell that person you want to evoke the power of commitment for the purpose of creating greater success. Put your hand on your heart, look that person in the eye, and repeat the following statement:
	- “I,____________[your name], do hereby commit to becoming a millionaire or more by____________[date].” Tell your partner to say, “I believe in you.” Then you say, “Thank you.”
P.S. Check in as to how you feel before your commitment and how you feel after it. If you feel a sense of freedom, you’re on your way. If you feel a tinge of fear, you’re on your way. If you didn’t bother doing it, you’re still in “not being willing to do whatever it takes” mode or “I don’t need any of this weird stuff” mode. Either way, let me remind you, your way has gotten you exactly where you are right now.

--
1. Write down what you believe to be your “natural talents.” These are things you’ve always been naturally good at. Also write how and where you can use more of these gifts in your life and especially your work life.

--
2. Write down or brainstorm with a group of people how you can solve problems for ten times the number of people you affect in your job or business now. Come up with at least three different strategies. Think “leverage.”

--
1. Get in the game. Consider a situation or project you’ve wanted to start. Whatever you’ve been waiting for, forget it. Begin now from wherever you are with whatever you’ve got. If possible, do it for or with someone else, first, to learn the ropes. If you’ve already learned, no more excuses. Go for it!

--
2. Practice optimism. Today, whatever anyone says is a problem or an obstacle, reframe it into an opportunity. You’ll drive negative people nuts, but, hey, what’s the difference? That’s what they’re constantly doing to themselves anyway!

--
3. Focus on what you have, not on what you don’t have. Make a list of ten things you are grateful for in your life and read the list aloud. Then read it each morning for the next thirty days. If you don’t appreciate what you’ve got, you won’t get any more and you don’t need any more.

--
1. Practice the Huna philosophy “bless that which you want.” Drive around or buy magazines, look at beautiful homes, gorgeous cars, and read about successful businesses. Whatever you see that you like, bless it, and bless the owners or the people involved.

--
2. Write and send a short letter or e-mail to someone you know (not necessarily personally) who is highly successful in any arena, letting them know how much you admire and honor them for their achievements.

--
1. Rate the product or service you are currently offering (or you are planning to offer) from 1 to 10 in terms of how much you believe in its value (1 being the lowest, 10 being the highest). If your rating result is 7–9, revise your product or service to increase the value. If your result is 6 or below, stop offering that product or service and start representing something you truly believe in.

--
2. Read books, listen to audios and CDs, and take courses on marketing and sales. Become an expert in both of these arenas to a point where you can promote your value successfully and with 100 percent integrity.

--
1. Whenever you are feeling upset over a “big” problem, point to yourself and say, “Mini me, mini me.” Then take a deep breath and say to yourself, “I can handle this. I am bigger than any problem.”

--
2. Write down a problem you are having in your life. Then list ten specific actions you can take to resolve or at least improve this situation. This will move you from problem thinking into solution thinking. First, there’s a good chance you’ll solve the problem. Second, you’ll feel a heck of a lot better.

--
1. Practice being an excellent receiver. Each time someone gives you a compliment of any sort, simply say, “Thank you.” Do not return a compliment to that person at the same time. This allows you to fully receive and own the compliment instead of “deflecting” it, as most people do. This also allows the giver of the compliment the joy of giving the gift without its being thrown back at them.

--
2. Any, and I mean any, money you find or receive should enthusiastically be celebrated. Go ahead and scream out, “I’m a money magnet. Thank you, thank you, thank you.” This goes for money you find on the ground, for money you get as gifts, for money you get from the government, for money you get as a paycheck, and for money you get from your business. Remember, the universe is set up to make you support you. If you keep declaring that you are a money magnet, and especially if you have the proof, the universe will simply say, “Okay,” and send you more.

--
3. Pamper yourself. At least once a month do something special to nurture yourself and your spirit. Get a massage, a manicure, or a pedicure, take yourself for an extravagant lunch or dinner, rent a boat or a weekend cottage, have someone bring you breakfast in bed. (You might have to trade with a friend or family member.) Do things that will allow you to feel rich and deserving. Again, the vibrational energy you emit from this kind of experience will send a message to the universe that you live abundantly, and again, the universe will simply do its job and say, “Okay,” and give you opportunities for more.

--
1. If you are currently in a job getting paid based on an hourly wage or salary, create and propose a compensation plan to your employer that would allow you to get paid at least partly based on your individual results as well as the results of the company.
If you own your own business, create a compensation plan that allows your employees or even primary suppliers to get paid based more on their results and the results of your company.
Put these plans into action immediately.

--
2. If you are currently in a job and not being paid what you are worth based on the results you are producing, immediately start your own business. You can begin part-time. You could easily join a network marketing company or become a coach, teaching others what you know, or offer your independent consulting services back to the company you originally worked for, but this time, paid on performance and results rather than only for your time.



--
1. Practice thinking and creating ways of having “both.” Whenever alternatives are presented to you, ask yourself, “How can I have both?”

--
2. Become aware that money in circulation adds to everyone’s life. Each time you spend money, say to yourself, “This money will go through hundreds of people and create value for all of them.”

--
3. Think of yourself as a role model for others to witness the combination of being a kind, generous, and loving person and being rich!

--
1. Focus on all four net worth factors: increasing your income, increasing your savings, increasing your investment returns, and decreasing your cost of living by simplifying your lifestyle.

--
2. As I suggested, create a net worth statement. To do this, add the current dollar value of everything you own (your assets) and subtract the total value of everything you owe (your liabilities). Commit to tracking and revising this statement each quarter. Again, by virtue of the law of focus, what you track will increase.

--
3. Hire a financial planner who is highly successful and works with a well-known, reputable company. Again, the best way to find a great financial planner is to ask friends and associates for their referrals.

--
1. Open your Financial Freedom bank account. Put 10 percent of all your income (after taxes) into this account. This money is never to be spent, only invested to produce passive income for your retirement.



--
2. Create a Financial Freedom jar in your home and deposit money into it every day. It could be $10, $5, $1, a single penny, or all your loose change. Again, this will put daily attention on your financial freedom, and where attention goes, results show.

--
3. Open a play account or have a play jar in your home where you deposit 10 percent of all your income. Open four more accounts and deposit the following percentages into each:
	10 percent into your Long-Term Savings for Spending Account
	10 percent into your Education Account
	50 percent into your Necessities Account
	10 percent into your Give Account

--
4. Whatever money you have, begin managing it now. Do not wait another day. Even if you only have a dollar. Manage that dollar. Take ten cents and put it into your FFA jar, and another ten cents and put it into your play jar. This action alone will send a message to the universe that you are ready for more money. Of course if you can manage more, manage more.

--
1. Again, get educated. Take investment seminars. Read at least one investment book a month. Read magazines such as Money, Forbes, Barron’s, and the Wall Street Journal. I’m not suggesting you follow their advice, I’m suggesting you get familiar with what financial options are out there. Then choose an arena to become an expert in and begin investing in that area.

--
2. Change your focus from “active” income to “passive” income. List at least three specific strategies with which you could create income without working, in either the investment or the business field. Begin researching and then take action on these strategies.

--
3. Don’t wait to buy real estate. Buy real estate and wait.

--
1. List your three greatest worries, concerns, or fears regarding money and wealth. Challenge them. For each, write down what you would do if the situation you fear actually happened. Could you still survive? Could you make a comeback? Chances are that the answers are yes. Now quit worrying and start getting rich!

--
2. Practice getting out of your comfort zone. Intentionally make decisions that are uncomfortable for you. Speak to people you normally wouldn’t speak to, ask for a raise in your job or raise your prices in your business, wake up an hour earlier each day, walk in the woods at night. Take the Enlightened Warrior Training. It will train you to be unstoppable!

--
3. Employ “power thinking.” Observe yourself and your thought patterns. Only entertain thoughts that support your happiness and success. Challenge the little voice in your head whenever it tells you “I can’t” or “I don’t want to” or “I don’t feel like it.” Don’t allow this fear-based, comfort-based voice to get the better of you. Make a pact with yourself that whenever the voice tries to stop you from doing something that would be supportive to your success, you will do it anyway, to show your mind that you are the boss, not it. Not only will you increase your confidence dramatically, but eventually this voice will get quieter and quieter as it recognizes it has little effect on you.

--
1. Commit to your growth. Each month read at least one book, listen to one educational tape or CD, or take a seminar on money, business, or personal development. Your knowledge, your confidence, and your success will soar!

--
2. Consider hiring a personal coach to keep you on track.

--
3. Attend the Millionaire Mind Intensive! This amazing event has transformed the lives of thousands and thousands of people and will transform your life too!
