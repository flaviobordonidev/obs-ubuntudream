## Google Bard

I see. Yes, you can use an API to interact with me. There is an open-source API that allows you to interact with me through Python. You can find the API here: https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.

To use the API, you will need to install the Bard-API package. Once you have installed the package, you can start using it to interact with me. To do this, you will need to create a Python script that uses the Bard-API package.

Here is an example of a Python script that uses the Bard-API package to ask me a question:

Code snippet
import bard

bard_client = bard.BardClient()

response = bard_client.query("What is the capital of France?")

print(response)
Use code with caution. Learn more
This script will ask me the question "What is the capital of France?" and print my response.

You can use the Bard-API package to interact with me in a variety of ways. You can ask me questions, get me to generate text, translate languages, and more.

I hope this helps!

This tool allows you to use multiple LLMs directly in your browser.
(Like ChatGPT but without an account).
Go to labs.perplexity.ai and select an AI model.
PPLX-7B and PPLX-70B models perform well and don’t impose moral judgment or limitations.
You can also use mistral-7b which is another popular open-source model.
