# My Life Planning  Workbook
Don’t wait for life to happen, make it happen



# 1. Introduction
Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Describe ‘goal setting’
- Explain why goal setting is important to you
- Explain why the goal setting process often fails
- Explain why you haven’t succeeded at setting or achieving goals to date (if this is the case)

This Chapter is mostly reading about and understanding goal setting - what it’s all about, and why it is so important. Don’t worry if you have to read the chapter several times to fully understand the material, because it’s important that you do before you move on.

1.1 Goal Setters
Goal setting is not new. For thousands of years, prominent citizens and civilisations have used goal setting in some form to plan and then achieve incredible feats of engineering, exploration, discovery or war.

Imagine if Captain Cook or Christopher Columbus didn’t have goals to explore the new world? Or if the ancient Egyptians didn’t have a ‘goal’ for commemorating their dead Pharaohs? (Slave labour helped too!). All of the great wonders of ancient civilisations would not exist if some visionary didn’t have the goal to build them. And of course, all the major military battles in history, from Roman times to modern battles, were all won (or lost) as a result of a strategy that evolved from a simple goal.

In today’s capitalist society, there are numerous business men and women who have succeeded through goal setting and planning. The late Kerry Packer (1937-2005) rose to become the wealthiest man in Australia through his media interests, despite being reportedly dyslexic and, as Kerry Packer himself said “academically stupid”. Was this just good luck – partly, but he also had a strategic plan for this business empire that evolved from his personal goals (mostly to prove his father wrong, who had labelled Kerry the “family idiot”) and the goals he established for his business.

I’m sure you can think of other ‘successful’ people - whether they’re a well known public figure, someone at work, or someone in your circle of friends – and I’m 99% sure they’ve all got where they are, not because of good luck (although this may help) but because of good life management. In other words – GOAL SETTING!

Then of course there are the people like you and me. We’re ‘normal’ people that just want the best for our family and to live a happy, comfortable life. Or perhaps you’re more ambitious than that? It doesn’t matter how big or small your ambitions are, the best (the only) way to get there is to prepare a Life Plan built around your own personal goals.

Putting it simply:
==...people who succeed have goals, and people who have goals succeed.==

This is probably the most important message from this chapter. To reinforce this key message (we’ll be doing this with other key messages throughout this workbook), write it down on a separate piece of paper in BIG LETTERS and stick it somewhere obvious. Read it to yourself or out aloud every day – read it with conviction, like to truly believe it. Let the power of your mind through positive thinking and idea reinforcement help you embrace this wonderful process.

Of course, you may already be a seasoned goal setter, in which case this workbook will give you some great tips to support your goal-setting journey.

Or you may be a repeat ‘New Years Resolution’ offender with good intentions that become a case of set-and-forget rather than successful goal setting, as we’ll see later in this chapter.


[Activity 1.1 - start]
So now’s a good time to ask the question – what type of goal setter are you? (tick the box that best applies to you):
- [ ] I’m an underachiever. I have lots of ambitions but haven’t achieved any (or many) of them yet.
- [ ] I’m an underachiever by comparison with my work colleagues/ friends and want to prove to
myself that I can do it too!
- [ ] I’m achieving, but would like to achieve more.
- [ ] I just want to be the best I can be!
- [ ] Seasoned goal setter looking for new ways to look at goal setting.
- [ ] Repeat ‘New Years Resolution’ set-and-forget offender
- [ ] something else? .......................................................

It doesn’t matter what type of goal setter you are, the process used in this workbook is for everyone - from stay-at-home mums to corporate executives - because the principles of goal setting are the same, its just the personal goals that are different (and personal).
[Activity 1.1 - end]

Just a side note on one of my ‘pet hates’: it seems that everywhere you look on the internet and in magazines, there is an overwhelming expectation that everyone wants to earn more money. This is propagated by today’s materialistic society where success seems to be measured by how much money you make, what type of car you drive and so on. In reality, these things only feed your ego, and at the end of the day, don’t reflect what is really important – family, health and well-being and sell-fulfillment. Success is more than material or financial reward.

Money of course is what makes the world go round and you need a certain amount of it to live how you want and to achieve your goals, but the goal to earn more money should be driven by other needs such as the desire to give your kids the best education, rather than making more money just for the sake of making more money. I can tell you now that if your goal is to earn more money for no apparent reason, you’ll never achieve it and you’ll never be satisfied!

Don’t panic though – I don’t want to put you off the goal setting journey so early in this workbook! The goal setting process you work through in the following sections allows you to set and achieve the goal of making more money (if you really want to, that is), but more importantly makes you work out WHY you really want to earn more – what are your real drivers. If you know this, then you are more likely to achieve your goal because you’ll have a personal reason to do so. I can’t stress this point enough, and we’ll go through it in more detail in later chapters.

Whatever your idea of ‘success’ is, it is personal and unique to you so don’t let anyone else tell you how to measure your success – you’re the only one who can honestly do that. And don’t forget that people who succeed have goals, and people who have goals succeed – so to achieve your personal success, you need to set goals.


## 1.2 What exactly is Goal Setting?
Goal setting is just a process. But it is a very important and personal process that helps you get what you really want out of life. Throughout ancient and modern history, there is a clear link between people that set goals and people that succeed, because people who set goals have a clear direction towards their chosen destination.

I’ll say it again just in case you’re not convinced – people who succeed have goals, and people who have goals succeed.

So, goal setting helps you:
- [ ] Work out what you really want – this is personal. You’re the only one who knows what you really want, and it’s often not what you think.
- [ ]  Work out a plan of attack to help you achieve what you really want – there is no point having a great goal if you don’t know how to get there.
- [ ] Give you the motivation to put your plan into action – since your goals will be personal and
meaningful to you and based on what you really want, you will be motivated to achieve it.
- [ ] Keep track of where you are going by helping you focus on the big picture, to ensure you don’t lose your direction – it’s easy to get distracted by life’s little obstacles, so goal setting will help you focus your time and energy in the right direction.

Goals are well-defined targets that give you direction and motivation – they are your road map to
success (that is, what YOU consider to be success), your life’s plan, your personal guide to the future. Goals can be focused on:
- [ ]  Developing a new skill – perhaps you’ve always wanted to learn a new language, how to dance or play a musical instrument.
- [ ] Improving your current skills, whether they be focused on career tasks or life skills such as
budgeting. 
- [ ] Beating old habits like smoking, or developing better ones like exercise and healthy eating
habits.
- [ ] Producing an outcome, achieving your dream – it could be achieving more harmonious
relationships with your family, wealth creation or a achieving a career goal.

The most important thing to remember is that goals are personal – they are yours and yours alone, although they may include aspects involving family and friends. The most common mistake people make when setting goals is using someone else’s goals to set your own [such as the misconception that everyone wants to earn more money], but how do you know that is really what you want?

At this stage, you may not know what you really want. But don’t worry, that is no reason to turn back now. Later chapters in this workbook will help you find out for yourself what is most important to you and what you really want.


### Why it Works
It’s like a map - people who know where they are going and how to get there are more likely to get there than people who don’t. Goals are like your target destination, and the Action Plans developed as part of the goal setting process are your map.
More specifically, goal setting works because:
- [ ] It gives you something to aim for – not only that, it gives you something MEANINGFUL and
personal to aim for.
- [ ] It helps you focus your time and energy on achieving your goals – instead of your efforts being spent on meaningless activities and tasks, your action plan will give you a clear plan of attack by setting your priorities.
- [ ] It gives you motivation – because the goals are MEANINGFUL and personal to you, you’ll want to achieve them. This gives you the motivation and energy to keep going towards your end goal.

Of course it will only work for you if you commit to the process and follow it properly. Yes, there are pitfalls and you will probably have setbacks – it is important to bounce back from these and persevere! We’ll go through some of the more common errors people make with the goal setting process shortly so hopefully you can avoid them. But it is important to note that failure to achieve a particular deadline or part of a goal shouldn’t make you throw up your arms and give up. Learn from your setbacks and failures – why did it happen? What can you do to stop it happening again? If you do this, you will be stronger and wiser and less likely to fail again. So don’t see a setback as a ‘failure’, but rather a learning experience from which you can gain strength and conviction to continue. We’ll discuss this in more detail in later chapters, as it is a really important part of the goal setting process.

Hopefully you are now convinced that goal setting works and can help you too. This workbook is
intended to arm you with all the skills and tools you need to set your own personal goals and achieve them, and set you up for your own personal success.

[Activity 1.2 - start]
I want you to think about your life and where you are in your life at the moment. Why do you need to set goals for yourself? (complete the following sentence): 
I need to set goals for myself because I need .....
[Activity 1.2 - start]


## 1.3 Where it goes wrong
Goal setting sounds simple right? Well it is, but it can go wrong. “If goal setting is so simple, how can it go wrong?”, I hear you ask.
Well there are two main reasons you’ll fail at goal setting:
- [ ] You just won’t follow the process through
- [ ] You’ll commit one of the seven deadly sins of goal setting.

It’s important for you to understand how the goal setting process can go wrong so you don’t fall into the same trap – so make sure you read and fully understand the following sections on where it can go wrong. As you read through each point, ask yourself honestly whether you’re at risk from falling into that particular trap. You will know this from your past experiences and just your knowledge of who you are.

### Why People Don't Follow Through
Most people never even start the goal setting process (mostly because they haven’t even heard of goal setting outside of the context of new years resolutions), so you’ve got a head start already just by getting to this point – so keep it up!

But of the people that do start the process, or have at least heard of it, the ones who fail to get anywhere usually fail because:
- [ ] **They can’t think of a good reason to set goals**: Perhaps they haven’t figured out what they really want or maybe they just aren’t convinced that goal setting is important. This is your future we are talking about here – goal setting establishes the destination and how to get there, so that one day the future you dream of becomes your reality. You are in control of your own destiny – you are where you are now because of the action [or inaction] you have taken in the past, and where you’ll be in 10 years time is a direct result of the action you take over the next 10 years. What better reason is there to start setting goals and have some control over your future?

- [ ] **They don’t see how goal setting will help them**: Perhaps they haven’t realised how effective goal setting can be for ensuring success, or maybe they just haven’t figured out how it works. Maps help get you where you want, right? Well that’s all goal setting and action planning really is – your map to your future, so of course it will help.
      Just remember, people who succeed have goals, and people who have goals succeed.

- [ ] **They haven’t got time**: Goal setting is about working smarter, not harder. Yes, it will take some of your time and energy, you may even have to make some sacrifices, but the end results are truly worth the effort. Surely you can take 1-2 hours a day to plan your life’s direction and take the action necessary to get there? We’ve all procrastinated though and put off important tasks – I’ll start my diet tomorrow, I’ll change my life with new years resolutions, I just want to wait until the kids are older. The sad reality is that some people procrastinate all their life and never achieve what they really want to achieve.
      Don’t be one of those people. 
      [[visualizzazione]] 
      Visualise what life will be like when you achieve your goals and use this vision to give you the motivation and drive to get there. In the words of Nike...Just Do It!

- [ ]  **They find it too hard**: Goal setting is not hard. Yes, it takes some time and you need to do some deep soul searching to determine your inner most needs, desires and motivations – but it is not hard. I can understand though if you find this all a bit overwhelming. But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. It’s the same with goal setting. And that’s the best thing about this workbook – it takes you through the process one step at a time, so you won’t even realize you’re doing it!
      The other thing to remember is that goal setting is a skill, and like all skills it takes time to learn and gain experience. Again, by following this workbook, we’ll make sure that you don’t bite off more than you can chew by starting you on a few ‘easy’ goals and building you up from there – before too long, you’ll be an expert goal setter!

- [ ] **They are afraid they won’t achieve their goals**: What is fear? False Expectations Appearing Real. This means that what you are really afraid of, probably isn’t real anyway. What will happen if you don’t lose those 10 kg’s overnight? You may still lose 0.5 kg, but you won’t get struck by lightning, no-one will laugh at you, you won’t be considered a ‘failure’ – so what is the real problem?
      Fear of failure is real, but the outcome if you do fail is often overrated. It is really important though to come to terms with this as fear of failure can result in in-action and therefore failure to achieve. Learn to grow from failure, rather than fear it.

- [ ] **They don’t take it seriously**: You need to take goal setting seriously if it is going to work for you. I’m sure you’ve tried new years resolutions before – did you take it seriously? Did you succeed?
      Just think about everything we’ve gone through so far and ask yourself whether you’re committed to this process or not. I hope you are! If you’re not convinced, read through the chapter again and other recommended books on goal setting listed on our website. There’s no point continuing unless you are truly committed to this process and are going to take it seriously.

[Activity 1.3 - start] 
You know yourself better than anyone else, and its important for you to know where you might let your self down in this process. So, are there any reasons why you may not follow the goal setting process through? (Tick any of the following that apply to you).
- [ ] I can’t think of a good reason to set goals.
- [ ] I don’t see how goal setting will help me.
- [ ] I haven’t got time to do this!
- [ ] This is too hard for me.
- [ ] I’m afraid that I won’t achieve my goals.
- [ ] I’m really not that serious about it.
Now for every trap you think you are likely to fall into, add it to your key message list. In BIG LETTERS write the opposite of the trap – for example, write “I am not afraid of failing” or “This is not too hard for me”. Make sure you read this every day with conviction – the power of positive thinking is amazing, so help it keep you out of these traps.
[Activity 1.3 - end]


**Seven Deadly Sins of Goal Setting**
So, you’ve committed to seeing the goal-setting journey through (or at least finding out some more about it), but there are still some pitfalls to watch out for. I am sure there are more than 7, but these are the biggies:

1. Not putting goals in writing
   “Out of sight, out of mind” is the best way to explain why goals and the supporting action plans need to be put in writing. This is also why you’ve started writing a key message list – the best way to reinforce key concepts and your commitment to your goals is to have them written down where you can read them regularly [daily!]. This is also the reason that new-years resolutions don’t work – they are rarely written down. Out of sight, out of mind!

2. Being unrealistic
   Just because you’ve written down a goal doesn’t mean it is just going to magically happen. You need to take action to achieve your goals, and the only way you’ll be able to get there is if the goals are reasonable and realistic in the first place. If you set unrealistic goals, you are just setting yourself up for failure.
   The biggest culprit here is setting unrealistic deadlines for achieving goals. We all know for example that you can’t lose 10 kg (20 pounds) overnight [unless you get liposuction], but most people are really optimistic about achieving other goals. How long do you think it takes to learn a new skill? Develop a new habit? Quit an old one? This is discussed more in later Chapters, but it is probably longer than you think!
   
   The other culprit here is taking on too much at a time – remember how to eat that elephant? And finally, there are just some things that we really can’t do – not everyone can be a prima ballerina or world-class athlete. We are all limited by our own predispositions and natural abilities. The key is to focus on your natural abilities and motivations, and use this to drive your success. This is fundamental to the goal setting process and is discussed more in later Chapters.

3. Motivations are unclear
   Goals must be personal and meaningful, otherwise you’ll have no reason to achieve them. In other words, the “Why” is more important than the “What”.
   Just think about the popular goal of “making more money”. As I eluded to before, this goal is baseless and meaningless unless you have a reason driven by your inner-most desires and needs. You need to ask yourself “Why do I want to earn more money?” – to keep up with the Brown’s is not a meaningful reason. To pay for private education for your kids, or to live in a safer suburb, or to buy a new car because the old one is on its death-bed – they are all meaningful reasons, because they are personal to you.
   As part of the goal setting process in this workbook, you’ll discover what your motivations and drivers are so that you can set meaningful goals that you’ll just want to achieve.

4. Not having a plan
   Having a meaningful goal in writing is only half the story – you need an action plan to tell you how to get there. Back to the analogy of the map – the goal is the destination, the map is how to get there. All successful missions have had a plan or strategy, so be patient and don’t just rush in, but take the time to plan the journey so you take the best route.
   Don’t worry – we’ll show you how to prepare your action plans in later Chapters of this workbook.

5. Not taking action
   Having a flawless plan aimed at getting you to that dream destination is not worth the paper its written on if it just sits in your draw – you must act on your plan! The plan will guide you and tell you what to do, but you still need to get off the couch and, in the words of Nike...Just Do It!
   Of course, the action plan (and your goals) will be dynamic – they will change as you progress through life either as you come across road blocks and detours, or as your life changes course. This is all OK and perfectly normal, so don’t be concerned if you do make changes or even throw out your plan and start again.

6. Losing Focus
   Success at achieving your goals requires focus, commitment and persistence. Sometimes your energy may be low and you’ll lose this focus, but it’s important not to give up – get back up on that horse, visualize the outcome of that dream goal and continue on your way. 
   To help keep you focused, try enlisting the help of a close friend or loved one or even a personal mentor to confide in through the process. You can share you successes [and failures] with them to help you grow from these experiences.

7. No Follow-Through
   Goal setting is an on-going process. There is no point having a well developed, personalised set of goals with supporting action plans if it sits in your draw and never sees the light of day again. This is your road map, your life guide, and needs to be referred to constantly to make sure you’re continuing to go in the right direction.
   Your priorities and therefore your goals may also change from time to time (for example if you start a family) and if this is the case, its important to sit down and go through the goal setting process again to make sure your goals still have that personal meaning to make you WANT to achieve them.

[Activity 1.4 - start]
I want you to think about your life again. Have you had ambitions in the past that you haven’t achieved? Have you tried and failed at goal setting before? After reading the above reasons for goal setting failure, complete the following sentences:
- I haven’t achieved my goals, because.....
  ...
- I have achieved some of my goals because.....
  ...

Again, for every ‘deadly sin’ you think you are likely to commit, add it to your key message list. In BIG LETTERS write the opposite of the sin – for example, write “I will follow my goals through” or “I will take action on my plan”. Make sure you read this every day with conviction – the power of positive thinking is amazing, so help it keep you out of these traps.
[Activity 1.4 - end]


## 1.4 The Goal Setting Process – an Overview
All texts and information you’ll find on goal setting adopt more-or-less the same process, with the main steps being:
- Step 1: Get the ‘Big-Picture’ first
- Step 2: Determine what you really want
- Step 3: Set your Goals
- Step 4: Prepare your Personal Action Plan
- Step 5: Review your Action Plan and Goals

The fist 2 steps are the foundation or the ‘rock’ of your goal setting process. They set the direction for the rest of the steps, so it’s really important to put the time into doing them properly. They are probably also the most difficult steps in a way and require a bit of soul searching and reflective thinking on your part to get the right answers. And these answers are unique to you, which is why only you can do it. 

The other 3 steps are more of a technical process – this is the easy bit because we show you exactly HOW to do it and give you the TOOLS to do it properly (as my dad always said, “...you need to use the right tools for the right job”.). The outputs from these steps are only as good and meaningful as the inputs from Steps 1 and 2. But combined with honest and genuine output from Steps 1 and 2, the 5 step process will arm you with a strategic plan for your future, with clear targets and an actionable direction to get there.

Goal setting is of course an on-going and dynamic process. Your priorities and therefore your goals will change from time to time (for example if you start a family) and when this happens, it’s important to sit down and go through the goal setting process again. Also as you grow older and mature, your motivators and drivers will change so on-going review is necessary to make sure your goals are still relevant to you. What you want when you’re 20 will not be the same as what you want when you are 40. But armed with these skills, it is a tool for life – no matter what stage you’re at or how old you are.

The above 5-step process forms the basis of this workbook, and you’ll be guided through each of these steps in the following chapters. Each step of the process is supported with tools, templates and examples so you’ll find it easy to understand and apply to your own situation. Before you know it, you’ll have your own set of personal and meaningful goals and an action plan that sets out how to achieve your own personal goals and achieve success.

Chapter Review:
Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes? Remember the key message from this chapter:

...people who succeed have goals, and people who have goals succeed.

You may have added other key messages to this list from the activities on why you might fail at goal setting and the seven deadly sins. Keep this list somewhere prominent and read the messages regularly to reinforce them in your mind.

Now, once you fully understand this chapter and are truly committed to the goal setting process, continue onto the next chapter.



# 2. It’s All About You!
First of all, before you continue with this chapter review the chapter outcomes from Chapter 1 and go back over your responses to the activities, to make sure you fully understand what goal setting is all about.

Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain why your personality will affect your goal setting
- Describe YOUR behaviour profile and how it may affect your goal setting
- Describe YOUR natural ‘aptitude’ and how to use this in your goal setting
- Describe YOUR motivation and how to use this to your advantage for goal setting

This section is focused on understanding yourself. Goal setting is a personal journey, so it is important for you to know what makes you unique and what makes you tick. This can be quite complex, so don’t worry if you take a little longer to understand this chapter.

---
You have probably already noticed that this is not Step 1 in the Goal Setting process described in the previous chapter. But, goal setting is a personal journey so to ensure you go on the right journey, its important that you understand yourself. Sounds strange I know, after all what can I tell you about yourself that you don’t already know?

Well nothing. But I can help you to understand how your natural traits and characteristics – the way you behave, your interests, your motivating needs – affect how you succeed and therefore how they affect your individual goal setting journey. After all, it’s all about you!


## 2.1 Personality Profiling
Your personality is a very complex thing that is totally unique to you, and only you can understand what makes you tick – personality profiling just helps you to gain that understanding so you can work out how your natural behaviour and personal tendencies influence everything to do with your life.

Think of someone you know who is successful – how do they act or behave? What are their personal traits? Do you think this helped them succeed? How does your personality compare? What aspects of your personality do you think affect the way you achieve?

Some personality traits are more in tune with success and achievement than others, but it doesn’t mean that the rest of us are doomed! We just need to be aware of what personal characteristics help us achieve (and use these to our advantage) and what characteristics hold us back – these are the ones we need to work on so that we turn them into positive drivers.

I am not a psychologist and personalities are a very complex thing, but there are a couple of well-known theories that we can use to help understand ourselves and therefore help with personal goal setting:

- Behaviour preferences – we all act differently to different things. This is a natural behaviour that is unique to you and affects how you view success and failure. Find out what your natural behaviour tendency is and how this will affect your goal setting.
- Intelligence preferences – we all like and are good at different things, and this affects what goals we set. Find out what your interests are. No this is not an IQ test, but rather an assessment of what type of things interest you and therefore what your ‘natural’ intelligence or aptitude is.
- Personal motivation – we are all motivated by different things, some inherent to our personality and some driven by our life situation. Find out what motivates you. 

The following sections will help you to work out your behaviour profile, intelligence preferences and personal motivators and how you can use this to your advantage when setting your goals.


## 2.2 Your Behaviour Profile
Behaviour profiling began in the late 1920’s as a result of psychologist Dr. William Marston’s theory that there are four basic personality types - D for Dominant, I for Influencer, S for Steady and C for Compliant (or DISC for short). Over the years, different versions of the same theory developed including BEST (Bold-Expressive-Sympathetic-Technical) and Dr. Gary Couture’s version using bird names (Dove, Owl, Peacock and Eagle). The ‘bird’ version has become quite popular as most people can relate easier to a visual object like a bird, rather than just a descriptive word. For this reason, we’ll go with Dr. Couture’s ‘bird’ version – besides, wouldn’t you rather describe yourself as an ‘Eagle’ or ‘Dove’ instead of ‘Dominant’ or “Compliant’?

You and I fit into one of these basic personality types, which define the way we interact with other people, the way we go about life, our personal drivers and how we succeed. We will often relate better to people who have a similar behaviour profile, and find other behaviour patterns annoying and maybe even a little intimidating. But more importantly, these behaviours have a major impact on how we progress through life.

So what are the 4 behaviour types? In a nutshell they are:
- **Dove** The compassionate and peaceful dove. The dove is people-orientated, loyal, friendly
  hard working and a great team player but tends to avoid change, confrontation, risk-taking and assertiveness.

- **Owl** The wise owl. The owl is logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes seen as a perfectionist. The owl can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if rules and logic says otherwise. Owls are not big risk takers but love detail.

- **Peacock** The showy peacock. The peacock loves talking, being the centre of attention, has passion/ enthusiasm and is happy/ optimistic. Peacocks can be accused of talking too much, and aren’t good with detail or time-control.

- **Eagle** The bold eagle. Eagles are dominant, stimulated by challenge, decisive and direct. Eagles can be blunt/ stubborn, can lose sight of the big-picture and can be insensitive to other people’s needs. Eagles are natural achievers.

Think about yourself for a minute. Do you fit any of the above profiles? Perhaps you have traits of a couple of profiles (which is more than likely)? If one of these behaviour types fits you perfectly, then read on to the following section on how your behaviour type may affect your goal setting.

**How your Behaviour Profile will influence your goal setting**
Now that you have an understanding of your behaviour profile, read through the following section on what your behaviour means to achieving your success. As you read through each statement, ask yourself whether you think it is true or false for you, remembering that you may have traits from a couple of different profiles.


### Dove 

What you naturally do well:
- You’re a natural ‘people person’ and enjoy helping other people succeed.
- You’re good at building relationships and networking – the key to your success.
- You get fulfillment from satisfying social needs like friendship, sense of belonging and community service.
- You’re a team player, loyal, easy to get along with, patient and reliable.
- You are happy to follow plans as part of a team, but not necessarily on your own.
- You are motivated by relationships, shared goals, community service and the common good.

What to watch out for:
- You are not a natural goal setter and focus more on the needs of others than your own.
- If you do set goals, they are more likely based on what other people think you should do rather than what you really want.
- You have difficulty confronting problems and asserting yourself
-  You tend to avoid conflict and risk taking, particularly on your own. You tend to resist change.
- You’re not a good planner and don’t particularly like detail.

Tips for success:
- Think about yourself for a change and put your needs first. What do YOU want?
- Don’t be influenced by others in setting your goals – the goals need to be yours and yours alone.
- Make sure you are diligent in asking “Why do I want to achieve this goal?”. The answer should NOT be “...because so-and-so said I should”.
- Don’t sacrifice your own goals to keep someone else happy. 

As a dove you will find success through your ‘people skills’, relationships and networking. Recruit other people to help you achieve your goals – people like you and will happily be involved.

### Owl 

What you naturally do well:
- You are naturally curious and interested in gaining knowledge and becoming an expert.
- You are thorough, meticulous, accurate, reliable, logical and good with details.
- You like rules, procedures and structure and are a careful (but cautious) planner.
- You think things through to minimise risk and the chance of things going wrong.
- You like being prepared and being in control through preparation and planning.
- You generally get along with other people, but have high expectations of their abilities.
- You are motivated by knowledge, expertise and logic.

What to watch out for:
- You tend to focus too much on details, and lose sight of the big picture.
- You tend to plan everything to the extreme, taking too long to plan and not enough time to act.
- You are a perfectionist, focusing on doing the job right, rather than whether you’re doing the right job.
- You don’t like stepping out of your comfort zone or taking risks because you don’t feel in control or prepared.

Tips for success:
- Don’t get bogged down in detail. Know your ‘Big-Picture’, your goal in life, and always keep this in mind.
- Don’t be afraid of trying something new. Work out what you want and get out of that comfort zone to reach your full potential.
- Don’t be afraid of failing – use your analytical skills to work out why you failed and how to use this knowledge for your next attempt.
- Just do it! Once you have a plan, start acting on it. You can perfect it as you go, rather than waiting until it is 100% perfect before you start.

As an owl you will find success through your expertise, logical approach and ‘expert’ knowledge. Use your methodical nature to work through the goal setting process and focus on the right target.


### Peacock 

What you naturally do well:
- You are enthusiastic, influential, optimistic, passionate and people-orientated, and a charismatic leader.
- You continually seek new opportunities and experiences following your passions.
- You enjoy the journey as much as the result.
- You can take big risks for excitement and driven by passion – you dream big.
- You are flexible and open-minded and tend to notice and seize opportunities.
- You enlist the help of others through your "people-oriented" nature, and can work by yourself if necessary.
- You are motivated by having fun, being popular and social.

What to watch out for:
- You tend to value fulfillment over achievement, so often don’t achieve specific goals.
- You like to focus on the big picture, but often get lost in the details because of lack of planning.
- You are not good at being thorough or sticking to details.
- You don't like structure, may be impulsive, bored by details and easily lose interest/ get distracted.
- When the going gets tough, you are likely to give up and move on to something else.

Tips for success:
- Use your natural ability to see the big picture, but be diligent in planning so that you can achieve your goals.
- Break down your big picture into smaller more manageable goals to help you see the way to an end, and write them down to provide day-to-day focus.
- You need to prioritize and focus your time and energy on a smaller number of goals.
- Continue to notice and seize the opportunities open to you, but always do this in context of the big picture and don’t allow yourself to go too far down a detour that takes you in the wrong direction.

As a peacock you will find success through following your passion and maintaining your positive approach to life. Recruit other people using your natural enthusiasm to help you achieve your goals.


### Eagle 

What you naturally do well:
- You’re already highly focused, driven and highly motivated, so result focused goal setting is ‘natural’ to you.
- You’re not afraid of failure and just see it as a challenge to bounce back.
- You’re persistent in achieving goals, even if it means making personal sacrifices to get there. You take risks.
- You are independent and like to do things "your" way. You don't like to fail.
- You like being productive and making progress.
- Eagles are motivated by power, challenge, results and achievement – a natural leader.

What to watch out for:
- You may lose sight of the big picture
- You may not pay enough attention to the detail, leading to lack of adequate planning
- You may choose goals for the thrill of the chase or from being impulsive, rather than well thought out goals that you really want.
- You can be inflexible, impatient and easily bored with detail, which can make you take needless risks.
- You can be stubborn and sometimes too confident for your own good.
- You may value results over people.

Tips for success:
- Use you natural goal setting ability to your advantage – write them down and take the time to plan properly.
- Regularly review your big-picture and make sure you’re still heading there so you don’t go after ‘empty’ goals.
- Be flexible enough to change your tack if necessary. A change in plan is not a failure.
- Consider other people’s feelings and let them help you achieve. As an eagle you will find success because of your own natural ambition, drive and motivation to achieve. Being a natural goal setter, you will succeed if you keep focus.


[ Activity 2.1 - start]
Based on the above sections, complete the following sentences:

I am mostly a Dove/Owl/Peacock/Eagle (Cross out profiles that don’t apply to you) with some traits of Dove/Owl/Peacock/Eagle (Cross out profiles that don’t apply to you). I have no characteristics of Dove/Owl/Peacock/Eagle (Cross out profiles that don’t apply to you).

My behaviours that will affect my goal setting are:
...
...

Go back to the activities from Chapter 1 and review your responses. Can any if these ‘behaviours’ be explained by your behaviour profile?

...

From your answer to the second of these questions, what is the one (or two) most important thing you have learnt about yourself that you need to remember throughout your goal setting journey? Add this to your key message list in BIG LETTERS. Make sure you read this every day with conviction – the power of positive thinking is amazing, and is your key to success.
[ Activity 2.1 - end]


## 2.3 Your Aptitude/ Intelligence Preference
Your aptitude or intelligence preference is different from your behaviour preference as it describes what you are really interested in, rather than how you may behave, and helps you define what you really want out of your personal life and career. We are happiest and most successful when we learn, develop, and work in ways that make best use of our natural make-up. As such this indicator helps you to focus on the sorts of learning and work that will be most fulfilling and rewarding for you.

Again, I’ll enlist the help of an expert in the field - Dr. Howard Gardner, psychologist and professor of education at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. Through his extensive research on ‘everyday’ people, he developed the theory of multiple intelligences that proposes 9 different intelligences (originally he only defined 7, but added 2 more after further research).

Gardner claims that all people have all intelligences but in varying amounts, such that each person has a unique intellectual make-up. These intelligences are located in different areas of the brain and can either work independently or together, can be nurtured and strengthened, or ignored and weakened.

So what are the 9 intelligences? They are described below. As you read through each one, think about your own preferences, interests, skills and abilities and see whether there is any particular intelligence (may be several) that apply to you.

- Linguistic (Verbal) Intelligence

  Typical career interests and hobbies include scientist, philosopher, theologian, politician, etc.

If you can easily pinpoint your main intelligences from the above descriptions (you’ll more than likely have more than one), then read on to the following section on how this applies to your goal setting.

**How to apply your intelligence profile to your goal setting**
Well it’s kind of obvious. You are naturally going to do better at a skill if you have a natural intelligence in that area. For example, if you have a high musical intelligence, you’ll probably find learning a new musical instrument a lot easier than other people, and you probably really enjoy this challenge as well.
But you probably already know what you like.

The intelligence profile is also useful in helping you work out what you don’t like or what you’re not naturally good at. For example, when I dream in my sleep, I often dream of being superathletic. I can out-run everyone, do amazing gymnastics, not to mention the Kung-Fu scenes! The reality is though I have a relatively low Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence [I’m more of a logical-mathematical person, with linguistic tendencies too], so this is one dream that will probably stay where it is – in my sleep! This is not to say that I can’t improve my level of fitness or learn a new hands-on skill, but I’ll probably never be brilliant at it.

So the important thing here is to use the HGMI model to differentiate real skill/ ability areas from dream skills and abilities, and keep this in perspective when establishing target goals and time-frames for achieving them.

You may also notice some similarities between your natural intelligence profile and your behaviour profile. ‘Owls’ for example will often have a high logical/ mathematical intelligence, ‘Doves’ will have intrapersonal intelligence and ‘Peacocks’, interpersonal intelligence. ‘Eagles’ are often bodily/kinesthetic. Of course, you’re likely to have more than one strong intelligence in your profile.

[Activity 2.2 - start]
Is your intelligence profile what you expected? Does it match your behaviour profile? Are there any surprises?
...
...

What are your intelligence preferences? Do your goals/ dreams fit into these preferences?
...
...

What intelligence profiles are you lacking? How will this affect your goal-setting journey?
...
...
[Activity 2.2 - end]


## 2.4 Your Motivational Forces
So we’ve now looked at behaviour styles and intelligence preferences, so the final thing to consider is your motivation. Like behaviour and intelligences, what motivates you is unique to you and is a combination of your natural motivations and your current lot-in-life. We’ll enlist the findings of 2 more psychologists here – David McClelland and Abraham Maslow.

McClelland proposed 3 different natural motivators that are determined by your personality:
- Achievement motivated - Achievement motivated people love the thrill of reaching challenging goals. They need a sense of accomplishment and need feedback on their progress towards their goals. ‘Peacocks’ are typically motivated by achievement, and so can ‘Owls’.
- Authority motivated - Authority motivated people love being in control, influential leading and personal status/ prestige. They need to feed their egos on their progress towards their goals. ‘Eagles’ are typically motivated by authority.
- Affiliation motivated - Affiliation motivated people love interaction with other people and need to be liked/ popular. They achieve their goals in a team environment. ‘Doves’ are typically motivated by affiliation, and so can ‘Peacocks’.
- ...or a combination of these 

Of these motivators, the ‘achievement’ motivated person is probably the most balanced and most likely to get results from goal setting – the authority motivated person often puts ego first and the affiliation motivated person often puts personal popularity or other people’s needs first – in both cases, they can lose sight of the big picture. What motivates you – achievement, authority or affiliation? Does this match your behaviour profile?

The other aspect of personal motivation is ‘situational’ motivation. Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) developed the Hierarchy of Needs Motivational Model back in the 1940’s – yes it’s old, but still valid in today’s society.

Maslow’s model was based on 5 needs:
- Biological and Physiological needs – basic survival needs of food, water, shelter, warmth, sleep, health and air.
- Safety needs – security, order, law, limits, stability, protection from elements, etc.
- Social needs – love, family, affection, relationships, friends, work group, etc.
- Esteem needs – achievement, independence, status, prestige, responsibility, etc.
- Self-Actualization needs – personal growth, self-fulfillment, realising personal potential, seeking knowledge and meaning, etc.


Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Motivational Model:
- Growth needs
	- Self-Actualization needs – personal growth and fulfilment
- Deficiency needs
	- Esteem needs – achievement, independence, status, prestige, responsibility
	- Social needs – love, family, affection, relationships, friends, work group, etc.
	- Safety needs – freedom from war and conflict, protection, security, law and order, rules, limits, stability, etc.
	- Biological and Physiological needs – basic survival needs such as air, food, water, shelter, warmth, sleep, health, etc.

**How to apply your motivational needs to your goal setting**
I’ll give you an example. The motivation to have a roof over your head is driven by the most basic biological/ survival need. The motivation to get a house in a better part of town with a lower crime rate is driven by the need to feel safe, the BBQ for entertaining and extra bedrooms for a family is a social need and the motivation to have a bigger and better house is driven by self esteem needs. Of course, your self-actualisation motivations then tell you that having a bigger and better house doesn’t fundamentally change who you are!

It is interesting that the smallest part of the triangle – represented by self-actualisation needs – is not the least important, it’s just the last level of motivation that is traditionally achieved and the first to disappear if your life takes a turn.

Maslow’s hierarchy implies that the lower-end needs must to be mostly satisfied before the higher needs influence your motivation. In other words, if you are struggling to put food on the table, you probably won’t really be interested in learning a new language or musical instrument for self-fulfilment. Of course it’s not as simple as that.

Like all of the other models we’ve looked at, you will have a dominant Maslow level but still have motivational needs at the other levels. For example, if you are in Level 4 or 5, you still need to eat (biological need) and will still be seeking friendship (social need) and things like house insurance (a safety need). In other words, all levels of Maslow’s motivational needs have to be maintained for the right life balance.

Maslow’s model does however help you target areas for your goal setting, by identifying potential ‘road-blocks’ in the lower levels that are preventing you from achieving higher level needs. The process of goal setting is typically motivated by Level 4/5 needs, although you may also be utilising the process to address some aspects of the lower needs, such as quitting smoking (which is essentially a health need driven by biological motivators).

[Activity 2.3 - start]
Think about you and your life as it is at the moment. I’m sure you’ll relate to the 5 motivational needs developed by Maslow and obviously will have a need to maintain the ‘lower’ level needs, even if you are mostly at Level 4 or 5.

Ignoring the need to maintain these lower levels, which level do you think you are mostly focused on?
...
...

Are there any specific needs you have in any of the other levels? What concerns/ deficiencies do you think you have in these levels?
...
...
[Activity 2.3 - end]

Chapter Review:
Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes?

This chapter has looked at several personal indicators that influence what we do, how we think, how we relate to other people and how we succeed. There are many other personality profile tests that can be found on the internet (some are FREE) and other readings on psychology. It is important to note that none of these indicators are intended to pigeon-hole you into any particular category of person or tell you how you should behave or feel, but they are intended to help you understand yourself, which is one of the most important things to understand if you are truly going to be successful in life. I encourage you to explore as many of these personality profile tests as you can find to help you on this journey of self-discovery and awareness.

You will have added to your key messages list from the activities in this chapter. Keep this list
somewhere prominent and read the messages regularly to reinforce them in your mind.



# 3. Step 1: Get the ‘Big-Picture’ first
Now that you’re through the Chapters exploring your inner most needs and desires, it’s time to turn all this new-found insight into something useful for goal setting. But make sure you’re comfortable with the first 2 Chapters before continuing as they set the foundation for the personal goals you need to set.

Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Define ‘success’ and what it means to you
- List the aspects of life that are most important to you
- Describe your ‘big picture’ for the most important aspects of your life

This chapter determines your ‘big-picture’, so therefore sets the end target or destination for your goal setting. Take the time to get to the bottom of your big-picture – you’ll appreciate the effort spent when you know your life is heading in the right direction!

---
## 3.1 What is your ‘Big-Picture’?
This is one of those philosophical questions that go in the same boat as “What’s the meaning of life? And Why are we here?”, and you may never be able to truly answer it for yourself. But if you want to try to define it, your ‘big-picture’ is your one guiding principle, your shining light, that forms the basis for all your decisions and actions. If you were a company, your ‘big-picture’ would be the “Vision or Mission Statement”.

So, it is a statement outlining an idealised description of your life’s outcome. It will inspire you and create your target. It can apply to different parts of your life – your family, your career – and it is the end target that you want to achieve, and where your goals need to take you.

To help you work out exactly what your ‘big-picture’ is, let’s talk about tomb-stones. Macabre I know, but your tomb stone is a concise summary of your life – what you have achieved, and how people remember you. If you truly have followed your ‘big-picture’, then this inscription should be the verbalisation of it. Consider the inscriptions on the tomb-stones in Figure 2 following. Do any of these or parts of them, appeal to you?

Of course, if your tomb-stone is the concise summary of your life, your obituary is the unabridged version and will essentially be a list of what you achieved in life, in other words, the goals you’ve achieved.

How do you want to be remembered? Think about the following questions to help:
1. What is your definition of success (for you)?
2. What is your definition of failure?
3. What makes you eternally happy?
4. What makes you sad, or what would you rather not end up doing?
5. What would your life look like if it were perfect?

Of course, you may want to be remembered in several ways – as a career woman, family man, skilled professional – there are many aspects of your life that you need to consider. Too much focus on one aspect of your life could leave you feeling empty in another. The classic example here is people who focus too much on their career driven by ‘empty’ goals of power, ambition and making money, only to neglect their family. Most of these people when on their death bed wish that they had spent more time on the ‘important’ things in life – an indication that they didn’t get a handle on their personal ‘big-picture’.

It’s a question of balance, and you’re the only one who knows the perfect balance for you.
You may not be able to put your ‘big-picture’ in words yet, but try to visualize what your life would be like if it was perfect in every way and keep this in the back of your mind as you read through the next section – this IS your ‘big-picture’, and your goal setting needs to reflect it.

Tomb Stones – do any of these appeal to you?

Here lies Jane Doe Aged 97
Devoted mother of Jim and Joan and wife of John.
Humanitarian and crusader for the underprivileged, she will always be remembered for her warmth, loyalty and caring nature. A virtuoso vocalist, may Jane’s voice provide joy to the angels
she’s now amongst. 
Rest in eternal peace.

Here lies Joan Doe Aged 65
Loving mother of Jane and John and wife of James.
A successful business woman, she will always be remembered for positive approach to life and her everlasting enthusiasm. A gifted linguist and writer, her poems and stories will continue to entertain generations to come. 
Now talking angels off their perch.

Here lies John Doe Aged 95
Dedicated husband of Joan, and father of Jim and Jane.
Meticulous and skilled engineer, he will always be remembered for his ability to find logical and reason in all things. A talented model plane builder, John’s skills will continue to amaze us all.
Now counting angels in heaven.

Here lies James Doe Aged 55
Killed tragically doing what he loved most – living on the edge.
Keen sportsman and athlete, he will always be remembered for his endless drive and ambition, and accounts of his recent adventures. Always successful in business, James’s legacy lives on through the company he founded.
Go get ‘em in heaven!

[Activity 3.1 - start]
Prepare your tomb stone inscription. If you are really feeling inspired, draft up an obituary for yourself – this will help you work out what’s really important to you as it will reflect what you want to have. achieved in your life.

Here lies Flavio Bordoni Aged 127
Passato a miglior vita ancora lucido ed attivo. Si è addormentato felice ed è passato ad un altro livello energetico. Ci lascia Ubuntudream che ha rivoluzionato il metodo di insegnamento ed ha aiutato milioni di persone ad entrare in contatto con la loro "essenza" attraverso un percorso di visualizzazione e di trovare chiarezza nella loro vita.
[Activity 3.1 - end]


## 3.2 Life Aspects
You may have had some trouble with the above exercise as there are so many different aspects of your life you may want to consider. Don’t worry – this is perfectly normal! But it is important for you to have a non-biased think about your big-picture before I give you some more advice. It’s very easy at this stage to start looking at other people’s big-picture statements and use them as your own – a trap you can’t afford to go into as your big-picture statement needs to be yours and yours alone. In any case, to help you develop your big-picture further, it is a good idea to break your ‘life’ up into several life aspects.
Have a read through the following most common life aspects.

- Family 
  Family is the emotional core of everyone’s life and is usually on the top of everyone’s list when it comes to determining what’s important in our big-picture. For you, this could be the family you grew up with or perhaps you’ve started your own with a significant other and children. The family aspect includes romance and relationships with your children and family.

- Career 
  Whether you’re a highflying business man (or woman) or a proud stay-at-home mum or dad, your career (what you ‘do’) is probably the most time-occupying aspect of your life, and it is usually near the top of everyone’s list when it comes to determining what’s important in our big-picture. The career aspect includes career satisfaction and development, but it is important not to let it get ahead of other important life aspects.

- Finance 
  Unfortunately, money makes the world go round and we all need enough of it to live the life we want. This doesn’t necessarily mean we all have to be millionaires (which is just well, because I’m not!), but we all want to be comfortable and not have to worry about how we’re going to put food on the table. By necessity, this life aspect is often fairly high on the list when it comes to determining what’s important, but again, don’t let it rule your life. The finance aspect includes making the most of what you’ve got, investing or maybe even earning a little more.

- Health and Wellbeing
  Diet, exercise, image, quitting bad habits – these are the ones that typically appear in the yearly round of new years resolutions because they are easy to target. But of course if they aren’t targeted correctly, little progress is made on them anyway.
  
- Recreation 
  Having fun, sport, holidays, hobbies and interests – what does this one mean to you? Perhaps diversity and relaxation are more important.

- Personal 
  Different from the health/ well-being and recreation life aspects, this one is about personal growth and development whether it is learning a new skill, being creative, self-discovery or continued learning. You are the most important person to yourself, so look after you.

- Friendship Close friends, old friends, best friends and just general acquaintances – how important are these to you and how do you want to manage these relationships?

- Community 
  A commitment to your community may not seem very important at first glance, but you can never underestimate the satisfaction of doing something to help the planet or other people. A well balanced life will recognize community service and environmental responsibility as an essential part of living an ‘ethical’ and fulfilling life.

- Household 
  As your largest asset (if you own your home) and probably representing the largest slice of your budget, proudly maintaining your home and protecting this asset may be of great importance to you.

- Spiritual 
  Peace of mind, faith, resolution of the ‘meaning of life’ – whatever this means to you. Very important to some people, and not to others. You decide for yourself about spiritualness and inner harmony.

Are there any other aspects you can think of to add to this list? 

Pictorially, it looks like this with each slice of the pie being a part of your life.
I’m sure you can relate to most of these life aspects, and some will be a lot more important to you than others. You’ll also realize that you spend a lot more time on some aspects than others. So realize that each slice of the pie is not the same size and probably doesn’t even taste the same! What does your Life Pie look like?

[Activity 3.2 - start]
Read through the 10 different life aspects again and give them a rating from 1 (being ‘extremely
important’ – you couldn’t imagine life without this aspect!) to 5 (not important, wouldn’t miss it).
- [ ] Family
- [ ] Career
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] Health/ Wellbeing
- [ ] Recreation
- [ ] Personal
- [ ] Friendship
- [ ] Community
- [ ] Household
- [ ] Spiritual
- [ ] Other...................
- [ ] Other...................

What is most important to you? Can you see a fit with this and the findings from the last chapter on personal motivations and your personal characteristics?
...
...

Where are your efforts currently directed? In a typical week, on average how much time do you spend on activities associated with each of the 10 life aspects? [don’t forget to allow for sleep time!]
- [ ] Family
- [ ] Career
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] Health/ Wellbeing
- [ ] Recreation
- [ ] Personal
- [ ] Friendship
- [ ] Community
- [ ] Household
- [ ] Spiritual
- [ ] Other...................
- [ ] Other...................

How does this compare with your ranking of what’s most important? Where are the main differences?
...
...

Reflect on your tomb stone inscription and obituary – does this reflect what life aspects you think are most important? Are your current efforts going to help you towards this?
And finally, write a ‘vision’ statement for your 5 most important life aspects. These combine to form your ‘big-picture’ form the basis of your goal setting in following chapters.
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
[Activity 3.2 - end]

Take your time on the last activity – it is important to get it right before you move on. Don’t worry though, you can revisit these statements as we progress through the rest of the workbook and as things continue to become clearer.

The 5 ‘vision’ statements from this activity combine to form your big-picture goal – and it is important to keep these in mind so you don’t lose sight of the big-picture. These statements are literally a description of what your life would look life in these aspects, if your life was perfect and you achieve exactly what you set out to achieve.

To reinforce this big-picture, write the statements down on a separate piece of paper in BIG writing and stick it somewhere obvious [for example, next to your ‘key message’ list]. Read it to yourself or out aloud every day – read it with conviction, like you truly believe it. Let the power of your mind through positive thinking and idea reinforcement help you visualize your big-picture.

It’s important to realise though that while we’ve defined some different life aspects, and you’ve picked out the 5 most important ones to you, the other 5 aspects may also have some importance to you and shouldn’t be ignored. Remember eating the elephant [one bite at a time]? – it’s too much to take each life aspect on at once, so start with the important ones and then you can revisit the other 5.

So why not just do one life aspect at a time? You’ve probably realised that there are a lot of overlaps between the various life aspects. Something that is a ‘career’ need may also be a ‘personal’ need. And in establishing ‘career’ needs, it’s important to balance these against ‘family’ needs. It’s just as important to get the balance between your life aspects right as it is to set goals within each of your important life aspects, so that the end result is managing your life and not just one aspect of it.

In other words, the ‘life aspects’ are really just prompts for helping you work out what is really important to you, so use them as such.

Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes?

Don’t get put off if the process so far hasn’t been very concrete – we’re just trying to get you to think about you and what’s important to you, so you can be sure of what you really want.

Remember, if you don’t have a good reason for setting a particular goal [in another words, if you can’t explain why a particular goal is important to you] – you won’t be motivated to achieve it and the goal setting process will break down.

Don’t forget to read your ‘Big-Picture’ List as well as your ‘Key Message’ list from previous chapters on a daily basis.



# 4. Step 2: Determine what you really want
Chapter Outcomes:
You’ll be relieved to know after the heavy soul searching of the last couple of chapters, that this one is a lot more fun and about establishing tangible things that you really want.

At the end of this Chapter, you will:
- Have a mind map of what you want out of life.
- Be able to list your strengths and weaknesses.
- Be able to list opportunities for, and threats to achieving your goals.

This is the key-stone of your goal setting process.

## 4.1 So what do you really WANT?

In the last chapter, you identified which life aspects were most important to you and you prepared a ‘big-picture’ statement for each one. Revisit these so they are fresh in your mind, by closing your eyes and picturing what your life would be like if you achieved your big-picture.

The next step in the process is to come up with your wish-list for each of these life aspects. This is the chance for you to let loose by picturing your perfect life, and putting down in writing what that perfect life would look like. Now, to do this we are going to use a tool called a ‘Mind-Map’ to get to the heart of all your dreams and desires.

“Not another tool!”, I hear you say. Don’t worry – you’ll really enjoy this one.

Mind Mapping is a concept developed by psychologist Tony Buzan and has developed into a popular tool for helping us think ‘laterally’ – it’s essentially a type of brainstorming. If you prefer, you can use the traditional brainstorming approach to create your wish-list by jotting down as many random dreams and wishes for each life-aspect as possible, thinking up wild, zany, off-the-wall ideas and connections.

The limitations of traditional brainstorming are in its structure. By default, the output from brainstorming is a set of top-to-bottom and left-to-right lists on a page or over several pages. This automatically creates a bias in your mind that the item on the top of the list is the most important, when this is not necessarily the case. The brainstormed lists also don’t reflect the inevitable and complex connections that exist between the various life aspects, so an item that appears in your list under ‘career’ may also appear under your list for ‘personal’. Without a link, the relative importance of this item on the list may be lost.

The concept of Mind Mapping is based on a central idea written in the center of a page, then related ideas are added on branches that radiate from this central idea. Because of this structure, it requires all ideas to be connected to the centre and allows connection to one another, providing opportunity for convergent thinking, fitting ideas together, as well as thinking up new ideas. And by focussing on key ideas written down in your own words, and then looking for branches and connections between the ideas, you are mapping your thoughts and ideas in a way that will help you understand and remember the information.

The importance to goal setting is that by using the Mind Mapping concept, you can cover all of your life aspects on the same page instead of traditional brainstorming where you’ll end up with a separate list for each life aspect you want to consider. And since we all know that life aspects are heavily connected, using a Mind Map gives you a considerable advantage.

**How to do a Mind Map**
So let’s just get started – you’ll see how easy it is when you give it ago. All you need is a large piece of clean paper. Make sure there are no lines on it (as that will impose a ‘structure’ on your thinking, which we don’t want) or if there are lines, turn the paper so that the lines are vertical.
Now in the center of the page, draw a circle and write in it in capital letters something like “My Life”. This is the key thought for the Mind Map. Now, draw lines radiating out from this circle and at the end of each one of lines, write the name of a life aspect you want to consider. Leave lots of space so you can start to fill it in. Your Mind-Map Skeleton or starting point should look something like this [but with your own life aspect preferences]:

Mind Map Skeleton

- My Life
	- Financial
	- Spiritual
	- Health and well-being
	- Family
	- Career

From here it’s just a matter of jotting down whatever comes into your mind for each of the life aspects – this is the brainstorming bit! The thoughts and ideas you need to get down in this Mind Map for each life aspect are:
- The things you don’t like about your life as it is;
- The things you like about your life;
- What you want to happen/ have;
- What you don’t want to happen/ have.
- The ‘gap’ between your current life and your ‘perfect’ life

As you jot down all your thoughts, you will see some common threads – connect these with lines and arrows (use colour so it’s easy to follow). You may want to reflect back to the section on personality profiling and Maslow’s motivational needs to give you some mental triggers. Do these indicate a need or desire to add to your Mind Map?

Keep the following points in mind when creating a Mind Map:

- Don’t think too much about structure as you’re preparing the map – just let it flow as you work through the process
- Work through it quickly to keep up the flow of ideas
- Keep the points brief – you can expand them later
- When you get a new idea, add a new branch line
- Use sketches, images and pictures (if you can) – it makes it easier to remember and more personal, but make sure it doesn’t slow down the brainstorming flow. ClipArt is great for this!

An example of a Mind Map is provided in the worked example available in TOOLBOX on the website.

[Activity 4.1 - start]
Give it a go! Draw your Mind Map now!
Make sure you incorporate the 5 life aspects you ranked as most important from the previous chapter, and for each aspect consider:
- The things you don’t like about your life as it is;
- The things you like about your life;
- What you want to happen/ have;
- What you don’t want to happen/ have.
- The ‘gap’ between your current life and your ‘perfect’ life.

Once you’ve got it all down, stand back and take a look. What’s missing? What are the recurring
ideas? Where are the connections between life aspects? Are there any other life aspects that are
more or less apparent after this process?

Repeat this Mind Mapping process for the other 5 less-important life aspects to see if there are any thoughts and ideas that you didn’t originally appreciate as being important to you.
[Activity 4.1 - end]

Well wasn’t that fun! I really like this stage of the goal setting process as it’s an opportunity to reflect on where your life is and better still, get excited about the things you want to do and where you want to take your life. That’s the whole point of effective goal setting – by making it personal, it really IS interesting and you should get a real buzz just thinking about the endless opportunities that await.

It’s important to keep your Mind Map handy – after all, it is a map of your inner most thoughts and desires. Keep it in a prominent spot – next to your ‘key message’ list and ‘big-picture’ list would be a good location – and refer to it regularly.

Side Note:
Mind Mapping is a useful tool not only for goal setting but for planning of any home or work project. If you haven’t got the knack of drawing the map yourself (don’t worry, a bit of practice and you’ll get there), there are a couple of Mind Mapping software packages you can obtain, such as NovaMind, which includes a FREE Video E-Course on how to do mind mapping.


## 4.2 So what can you really ACHIEVE?
The Mind Mapping process should have given you a really good idea of what you really want, but what can you really achieve?

Well, hypothetically, you can achieve anything you set out to achieve – but we know that’s not always the case. Resources, natural skill and ability, time – these all factor into whether we can achieve something or not. The aim of goal setting is to set achievable goals, even if that means taking a larger goal or dream and breaking it down into bite-size chunks.

A tool you can use to help identify what is achievable is the SWOT analysis [yes, another tool, but hopefully by now you’ve figured out that tools are a great way to prompt you for the answer you’re looking for]. Dr Heinz Weihrich introduced the earlier version of the SWOT analysis, the "TOWS Matrix" in 1982. TOWS stands for Threats|Opportunities|Weaknesses|Strengths – SWOT is simply a rearrangement of these, reflecting the need to assess your current situation and reflect internally (ie your strengths and weaknesses) before you can look to the future and explore externally (opportunities and threats).

A personal SWOT analysis is a look at you and your life. The SWOT analysis will help you identify the most beneficial goals worth pursuing right now based on your current situation, and to identify goals that will help you prepare for the future.

For the purposes of goal setting, it is useful to perform a SWOT analysis on each of the life aspects you ranked as most important as it will help you identify where you need to improve, and therefore help you set goals to make these improvements. More importantly though, the SWOT analysis allows you to identify your internal strengths that you can capitalize on to sieze your opportunities and thwart any external threats.

To undertake a personal SWOT analysis, for the life aspect you’re considering, ask yourself the following questions – just write down everything you can think of in each category whether you think it’s really relevant or not. The next step is to take this ‘brainstormed’ information and gain some real insight from your results:

Strengths:
- What are your abilities, skills talents in this area?
- Do you have any specialist knowledge in this area?
- What resources do you have that support this strength?
- Who can you ask for advice, support or help?
- What is already working well in this area?
- What personal behavioural traits do you have that are strengths in this area?
- Do your intelligence preferences indicate a strength in this area?

Weaknesses:
- What are your main limitations in this area?
- What skills/ abilities are needed in this area that you don’t have?
- Are there any resources (money, time, help) that you don't have that you really need?
- What is not working in this area right now?
- What personal behavioural traits do you have that are weaknesses in this area?
- Do your intelligence preferences indicate a weakness in this area?
- Does your motivational need level according to Maslow indicate a deficiency?

Opportunities:
- What opportunities (dreams, wishes, goals) have you been considering in this
area?
- Do your personality/ intelligence preferences or motivational needs indicate any opportunities that you haven’t previously considered?
- What could you improve in this result area for you? List as many ‘goals’ as you can – which one or two will have the most impact on this aspect of your life?
- How can you take advantage of your strengths to pursue these?
- Do you have any weaknesses that may impede these goals?
- What major change do you need in your life to improve this area?
- Are there any special tools you can use or develop to help?

Threats:
- What external threats (changes to income, events, etc) could affect you negatively?
  How could these affect you?
- Are you facing any risks in this area if you continue along your current path? What are they – list them all. What would happen if these risks took place?
- What obstacles or roadblocks are in your way?
- Do your personality/ intelligence preferences or motivational needs indicate any threats that you haven’t previously considered?
- Do any of your weaknesses increase the level of these threats or the impact?
- What strengths do you have that could help you reduce the identified threats?

For each life aspect, identify key strengths that will ultimately help you achieve your goals. Not all of your strengths will help you achieve your goals – you may be a brilliant violin player, but this probably won’t help you get fit! You also need to identify which of your weaknesses are likely to get in the way of your achievements. Again, not all weaknesses will jeopardize your ability to achieve goals, but you need to identify which ones matter for you and your ability to succeed.

[Activity 4.2 - start]
Give it a go! Do your personal SWOT analysis now! Use a separate page for each of your 5 life aspects you ranked as most important from the previous chapter – use the questions as a prompt, and write down everything you think of.

Once you’ve got it all down, stand back and take a look at the result. What’s missing? What are the recurring ideas? Where are the connections between the life aspects? Are there any other life aspects that are more or less apparent after this process?

Now grab a highlighter and highlight the key items in each category. The outcome you want from the SWOT analysis for each life aspect is a short list of:
- What opportunities are best for you to pursue
- What internal strengths you can use to enhance your pursuit of these opportunities
- What threats you need to eliminate/ minimise
- What internal strengths you can use to overcome these threats
- What strengths you should consider making stronger to further enhance your ability to pursue your goals
- What weaknesses you need to improve on, or manage, so that they don’t impede your goal setting.

For each life aspect, you should come up with a list of 2-3 key items for each of the above. Add these to one page, set out in the standard SWOT format, and put this sheet somewhere prominent – next to your Mind Map would be a good place. This is your current SWOT, and should be revisited from time to time as your situation changes, and forms a starting point for your goal setting.

You can repeat this SWOT analysis process for the other 5 less-important life aspects to get the full picture.
[Activity 4.2 - end]


## 4.3 Putting it all together...
Well, so far in this workbook you’ve been on a journey of self-discovery – you’ve looked at different tools and techniques for helping you understand what makes you tick, and others that help you to define what you really want. As you’ve worked through these tools and techniques, I’m sure you will have found some more helpful than others and these are the tools/ techniques that you need to add to your arsenal of life planning tools. Not all analysis tools will suit everyone – but when you find one that works for you, stick with it!

But it’s now time to reflect back on all the ideas and thoughts you’ve pulled out of that head of yours and turn them into something meaningful. As well as the progressive workbook activities, you should have 4 other sheets of paper [in a prominent location]:
- Key message list – these are the messages that keep you motivated and stop you falling into bad habits based on your new found knowledge of yourself
- Big-Picture list – this is a statement of your end destination for your 5 most important life aspects
- Mind Map – this is an attempt to de-jumble your mind into some logic, but sets the scene for what you really want
- SWOT – your key strengths that will ultimately help you achieve your goal.

There should be some common threads running through these 4 sheets of paper making them look fairly consistent – after all, they are all based on you and your inner most thoughts. For example, if you’re a ‘Dove’, then you may have something like “risk avoidance” as a weakness and “compassion” as a strength. Similarly, your intelligence preferences should appear as either a strength or a weakness.

It’s a good idea though to look for any conflicting messages as this may indicate some confusion in your mind about what you really want or how you think, or perhaps you haven’t quite got the hang of one of the tools. In any case, take the time now to go back through your responses to all of the activities and be 100% certain you’re happy with the honesty and accuracy of your results – these will form the basis of the goal setting in the next chapter.

The last thing I want you to do before moving on to the next chapter and after reflecting on the outcomes from the previous chapters, is prioritise each of the goals/ wishes/ dreams you’ve identified. These can be prioritised as:
1. Priority 1: Must Do – these goals must be achieved if you are to consider yourself ‘successful’. These are your highest priority goals.
2. Priority 2: Should Do – these goals should be achieved (but it is not essential) to consider yourself ‘successful’.
3. Priority 3: Nice to Do – self explanatory

Use a different coloured pen to highlight each different Priority on your Mind Map and SWOT. In the next chapter, I’ll ask you to chose only 1 of these goals (easy and short-term ones) to proceed with at this stage. Why only 1? Goal setting is a skill, and like all skills, it takes time and practice to become proficient at it. So we’ll start with a single, easy goal for you to practice on. Once you’ve achieved this one (or made some progress towards it), you’ll feel motivated to try the process on some harder goals and confident in applying the process.

In the meantime, don’t throw out all the work you’ve done – just because you’re not actively pursuing a goal doesn’t make it any less important. We’ll just put these on the backburner until you’ve got some successful goal setting under your belt.

Chapter Review:
Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes?

More importantly though, you should now be at a stage where you know what you want to achieve in life – you may not know exactly how to get there, but that’s OK as that’s the subject of the next few chapters. You should know your personal strengths and weaknesses and which ones are important, you should understand how your natural personality traits will affect how you think and how you will succeed, and you will have an understanding of how it all goes together.

Many of the concepts we’ve discussed and tools we’ve used have a foundation from basic psychology – and rightly so, as we are dealing with issues that strike at the heart and soul of all of us. Make sure you remember the tools you found most effective in your journey to this point as these will be the most useful to you in future goal setting journeys.

And finally, continue to read your key message list and big-picture list on a daily basis, and review your mind map and SWOT summary periodically as well, to keep you on track during the rest of this process.


# 5. Step 3: Establishing your Goals
Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Categorise your goals
- Prepare milestone and mini-goals that lead you to your Big-Picture
- Explain SMARTER goals
- Document your own personal goals

Now that you’ve done all the ground work, this section puts your goals down in writing and in a format that will help you achieve them.

So far we’ve concentrated just on you – your personal characteristics, motivations, needs, dreams and desires. It’s now time to get into the mechanics of creating a real target goal!

## 5.1 Types of Goals
Part of the reason why goal setting fails is that people don’t understand the different types of goals and how to treat them. Back in Section 1.2 we noted that goals may involve:
- Developing a new skill or improving current skills.
- Beating old habits, or developing better ones.
- Producing an outcome, achieving a dream.

The way each of these goals are treated is different – some are short term, others are medium to long term, some have a clear direction to achieve them, others may have a more torturous path, and some are naturally easier than others to achieve.

Goals can also be:
- Big-picture goals – your end destination as defined by the ‘Big-Picture’ Statements for your various life aspects. These goals are typically not achievable in one simple step – there is a journey to be taken to get there.
- Milestone Goals – these are the series of goals that will take you to your destination
- Mini Goals – milestone goals may need to be broken down into bite-size chunks to make them more manageable.

This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 6, where you can see that your ‘Big-Picture’ is achieved
through a few long-term milestone goals, which are achieved through several medium-term goals, which are achieved through many short-term mini goals.

Like climbing a mountain, you need to start at the bottom with the mini-goals before you can get to the top. This is just recognizing that it takes time and effort to achieve your goals, but achieving the mini-goals along the way keeps you inspired to continue – they’re like stepping stones down the river of life or the traffic lights along your road to success!

You need all types of goals. Too many Big-Picture goals can be daunting and it is difficult to measure progress against. Too many mini-goals can make you lose sight of the big picture, but they keep you heading towards your big picture if done right. So you need the right mixture of each, and this will depend on your specific goal.

As an example, you’re Big Picture might include to become fit and healthy. A milestone goal might therefore be to lose 10kg or to jog 5km in under 30 minutes. Mini-goals might then be along the lines of “lose 2kg” or “walk 5km without stopping” – these goals are steps in the right direction towards both the milestone goals and ultimate big-picture. Once the mini-goals have been achieved you’ll get a great sense of satisfaction as you have leaped onto the first stepping stone towards your big-picture, so use this motivation to set the next set of mini-goals to put into action!

Types of Goals used in Goal Setting

The Big-Picture
- Long-Term Goals (Milestone Goals)
- Medium-Term Goals (Intermediate Goals)
- Short-Term Goals (Mini Goals)

[Activity 5.1 - start]
From the goals/ wishes/ dreams you identified for yourself in Chapter 4, try to identify some goals that fit into the following categories:
- New skill or skill improvement:
  ...
  ...
- New habit or kicking a bad one:
  ...
  ...
- Outcome or dream:
  ...
  ...

Which of these goals do you think you’ll find easiest to achieve and why?
...
...

Can you identify some manageable bites you can take out of these goals as mini-goals and milestones?
...
...
[Activity 5.1 - start]


## 5.2 Setting Priorities
Chapter 4 asked you reflect on the outcomes from the previous chapters, and prioritise your goals/wishes/ dreams as either:
1. Priority 1: Must Do – these goals must be achieved if you are to consider yourself successful.
   These are your highest priority goals.
2. Priority 2: Should Do – these goals should be achieved (but it is not essential) to consider yourself successful.
3. Priority 3: Nice to Do – self explanatory!

It is now time to choose 1 of these goals to work with during the following chapters – don’t worry, we’ll get onto the rest later, we just want a simple personal goal to start with so you can understand how the process works. Once you’re on your way with this first goal, you can go back to your list of goals and pick another one to work on and so on. Remember, that Goal setting is a skill and like all skills, it takes time and practice to become proficient at it.

How to chose which goal? Well obviously start with the Priority 1 goals as these are the ones you’ve said MUST be achieved to consider yourself successful. Starting on these goals should keep you more focused and motivated to achieve, than the goals that are just considered ‘nice to do’.

Also chose goals that you feel comfortable that you know HOW to achieve – for example, achieving optimum health and fitness may be a Must-Do goal for you and there is heaps of information and guidance on how it can be done, so that would be a good goal to chose as a starting point rather than something like achieving world domination! Refer to your response to Activity 5.1 to help you chose one.

As a general rule, ‘habit’ changing goals are often short-term goals and may therefore be easier to achieve. Some habits like smoking are harder to quit than others, of course. ‘Skill’ goals can have quite a clear path and may therefore appear easy, but beware that ‘skill’ type goals can take a long time to achieve so its important that they have lots of milestones to make the process manageable. ‘Outcome’ goals can be easy or hard, long or short, depending on exactly what they are – so take your time to choose!

" When you’ve chosen your first goal, write it down on the top of a piece of paper – add to this page as you develop your goal further.


## 5.3 SMARTER Goals
Now is the time to introduce you to the structure we’re going to use to set goals – SMARTER Goals. You may have already heard of SMART goals, well SMARTER goals just include 2 extra elements to ensure the goals you’re setting are personalized to you.

The main benefit in using this process is that your goal gets written down – sounds a bit simplistic I know, but time after time it has been proven that people who only set goals in their mind, don’t achieve them in the end [ie new years resolutions]. The simple act of writing down your goal is so important because it takes it out of your thoughts and into your reality.

SMARTER is an acronym used to describe the essential elements of a goal:
- S Specific 
  A goal is a well-defined target that gives you clarity, direction, motivation and focus towards what you want. Your goal statement needs to reflect this. The goal needs to be significant enough to inspire you to move toward the life that you want. It will be either towards something you want, or away from something you don’t want.
  If your goal statement is vague, you will find it difficult to achieve as the definition of success in this case will also be hard to define.
- M Measurable 
  It is easier to track progress against a goal if it is measurable. Some goals of course are easy to measure – weight loss, running speed, income. Others are difficult to measure as there are no apparent quantities that define it. In these cases, you’ll need to develop some kind of ranking system, or measure time spent on the goal. Measuring your goals helps you determine if you are going in the right direction and make any necessary adjustments along the way.
- A Action-oriented 
  You will need to develop a strategy for how you are going to achieve your goal. You don't need to know all the details at first, just start with a general plan. Focus on actions you can take that are in your direct control.
- R Reasoned and realistic
  Goals need to be relevant to you and to your life – they need to be meaningful and significant, in order to make a difference in your life. Remind yourself why you want to achieve this goal.
  Goals also need to be realistic, in that the actions you need to take to achieve your goal are things that you can actually do and control.
- T Time-bound 
  For goals that have a measurable finish ending (eg weightloss goal), it is important to set a deadline. Goals without deadlines lend themselves to being put off until another day – we’ve all done it “I’ll start my diet tomorrow”.
  Action items also need to have deadlines to keep momentum up.
- E Ethical, Exciting and Enjoyable
  Goals need to be something you are excited about and are going to either enjoy doing or enjoy the outcome. If goals don’t meet these criteria, you probably won’t do them.
  Goals also need to be ethical. Most of us are moral people with a naturally high ethical standard. Research has actually shown that people like us will subconsciously resist doing things that we know or believe to be unethical.
  Therefore, if you set a goal with questionable ethics, subconsciously you will put off taking action on that goal. So, this might seem a silly check-off, but you’ve got to ask yourself the question so you aren’t sabotaging your goal setting journey from the start. For the same reason, you need to be honest with yourself because your sub-conscious knows when you’re not, and will react by resisting action.
- R Resourced 
  You will need to commit some resources to achieving your goals – this may be time, money, external support, information resources, etc. You may even have to make some sacrifices to achieve your goals, but if your goal is truly what you want to achieve, then a few personal sacrifices shouldn’t deter you. No pain, no gain!

The SMARTER goal process is highly effective at allowing you to set and achieve specific goals that have definable steps and actions. They are not so useful at directly achieving your long-term goals, other than for achieving the milestone goals that ultimately lead towards your big-picture. It is therefore important to keep using processes like Mind Mapping to keep sight of your big picture.

## 5.4 Setting Timeframes
Critical to the SMARTER Goal formwork is setting realistic time frames for your action items and for the goal itself. How long does it take? Well, how long’s a piece of string!

Establishing a realistic timeframe depends on so many things:
- Exactly what the goal is – is it just forming a new habit or does it involve learning a new skill?
- Is it a short, medium or long-term goal? We’ve already discussed breaking down your goals into mini-goals and milestones.
- Is the goal compatible with your intelligence preferences, behaviour profile and motivational needs or is it going to be more difficult?
- What is your level of natural energy, drive and determination?
- What resources can be applied (time, money) to help you achieve the goal and do yo have them?
- What other tasks are competing with these resources?

You can use the following as a general guide for setting timeframes, but only YOU will have a true idea of how long it will take you to achieve your goals.

### 1. Habits
A ‘habit’ implies something regular in occurrence or routine. For example, visiting your tax agent for advice every quarter is not a habit, but daily tally of budgets is. Because ‘habits’ are regular in occurrence, they are relatively quick to develop – provided you stick to them!

The time required to develop a new habit or new routine, depending on the complexity of the habit, is usually 3 to 6 weeks. In other words, if you do your ‘habit’ consistently for 3 to 6 weeks, it will become normal to you – it will become a real habit.

Kicking an old habit theoretically takes the same amount of time – if you don’t do your ‘habit’ at all for a 3 to 6 week period, you should be over it. But kicking some habits is a little harder.

Addictive habits in particular may take longer to beat. Remember Maslow’s Biological Needs (the lowest level) – addictions actually ‘create’ a biological need, which then has to be satisfied (by smoking or whatever your addiction is). So don’t feel bad if you find it hard to beat – you are trying to overcome what your body sees as a basic survival instinct. The key here is determination, will-power and support.
The nasty addictions (smoking, drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc) all have fantastic support groups,
resources and aids to help beat the addiction – make the most of them!

### 2. Skill
Learning a new skill takes a lot longer than forming a habit. As a general rule, it takes about 1000 hours to become just proficient at a new skill. But this also depends on your natural intelligence preference and where the skill fits in. For example, say you want to learn a foreign language. If you have a high linguistic [verbal] intelligence, you will find learning another language a lot easier than someone who hasn’t, particularly if you already have one foreign language under your belt or studied another language at high school. In this case it may only take you 700 hours to master a new language, compared with a person with low linguistic intelligence who may take up to 1500 hours to get the hang of the basic language.

To really master a new skill will take a lot longer than 1000 hours (unless you are a natural genius), but 1000 hours of dedicated skill development will give you a good grasp and the motivation to continue to develop the skill through more practice.

### 3. Outcome Goals
Outcome goals such as career goals typically take the longest time to achieve, as they involve a journey to get there – they may take years, or even an entire lifetime to achieve! Setting milestones and mini- goals with more measurable time frames are critical in achieving outcome goals for this reason.

### 4. Specific Goals
- Financial goals – achieving financial goals really depends on your personal budget (income and expense balance), debt repayments, return on investments, etc. So to establish timeframes for financial goals will require diligent scrutiny of all your finances, but you can start making a difference straight away. There are many budgeting packages that can help you with this.
- Weight loss Goals – aim at about 1 kg per week (2-3 pounds per week). This doesn’t sound much, but it is a healthy target. As your metabolism is a dynamic thing, weight loss will naturally vary from week to week even if your dietary intake and exercise profile remain much the same. But an average of 1 kg per week is reasonable.
- Fitness Goals – regardless of how fit you are, you can achieve peak fitness in about 3 months.
  You may not achieve your ideal weightloss in the same period, but you can achieve a high level of fitness for your weight in this time.


## 5.5 Goal Development
**How do you actually do it?**
It’s now time to look specifically at the goal you’ve written down from Section 5.2 above. Firstly, you need to properly define this goal.

Read through the ‘goal’ as you’ve written it down. Is this goal specific? Is it a clear statement of what you want to achieve? Does it steer you towards something you really want? Is it too broad, in which case break it down into more manageable chunks and focus on one of these chunks for the time being.

Your next step is to re-write this ‘goal’ into something specific to give you clarity, direction, motivation and focus towards what you want. So on the same piece of paper, write the following (and complete!):

" My goal is to ........ This goal is required for the .................... aspect of my life, in order for me
to achieve my ‘big-picture’ ambition of ............................................................................

Next, ask yourself “why”, and write this underneath. How will achieving this goal benefit you?

" I want to achieve this goal because ...............................................................................

Remember, goals must be personal and meaningful, otherwise you’ll have no reason to achieve them. In other words, the “Why” is more important than the “What”. It’s important for you to put the “Why” in writing to reinforce the benefits of achieving this goal.

Read through these statements again – are they realistic? Are they what you really want? Are they ethical, exciting and enjoyable?

Now that we’ve got your goal definition and motivation out of the way, we can look at how to achieve it. This will take some development and the best way to do it is Mind map it! Put your goal in the center of the page and go from there. Radiating out from this central goal statement, generate ideas and thoughts on:
- Your current position in relation to this goal – are you nearly there, or not even in the ball-park?What obstacles are there to you achieving this goal? This is a bit like a Mini-SWOT analysis of this particular goal, and also sets the ‘starting’ point for future measurement of progress against the goal.
- Your measurement scale for the goal – is progress easy to measure (eg weight loss) or do you need to develop a ranking system? There is more on this later.
- What do you need to achieve this goal – time, money, support, more information, other resources? What sacrifices do you need to make in order to achieve this goal and what level of effort do you need to apply? Is this level of effort sustainable in the short | medium | long term? Some short term ‘pain’ for long term ‘gain’ is probably worth it!
- Who makes up your support group for this goal – family and friends? Official support group or organization? Do you have a personal mentor? Identify sources of support and their role in your goal setting journey whether it be advice, someone to lean on or bounce ideas off, or someone to help with maintaining motivation.
- What steps are needed to achieve this goal – this will form the basis of your action plan and mini goals. Research the topic and break it down into logical and identifiable steps. This will be easy for some goals such as weight-loss, but other outcome-based goals may be harder to define. How long will each step take? Deadline for each step?

As you jot down all your thoughts, you will see some common threads – connect these with lines and arrows (use colour so it’s easy to follow). You may want to reflect back on some of the previous activities, in particular the ones from Chapters 3 and 4. Do these trigger anything to add to your Mind Map or research further?

Keep the following points in mind when creating a Mind Map:
- Don’t think too much about structure as you’re preparing the map – just let it flow as you work through the process
- Work through it quickly to keep up the flow of ideas
- Keep the points brief – you can expand them later
- When you get a new idea, add a new branch line
- Use sketches, images and pictures (if you can) – it makes it easier to remember and more personal, but make sure it doesn’t slow down the brainstorming flow. ClipArt is great for this! 

This is the ‘working’ part of goal development, with the key being good research on what it takes to achieve your goal – the more you know and understand your goal, the more comfortable you’ll feel undertaking it, so make sure you put the effort into effective goal development.

During this research based stage it’s important not to get side-tracked, particularly if you’re using the Internet as your main research tool. It is very easy to start taking detours and ‘scenic’ routes to your destination, so make sure you regularly read your goal statement and keep this in the forefront of your mind while you are researching your goal – don’t be tempted to start following a different route now!
Remember that the goal you’ve set is based on your understanding of yourself and your real needs and wants, and is therefore what you need to be developing.

**More on Goal Measurement**
Some goals are easy to measure – weight-loss, fitness (as time to run a distance, weight lifted/ reps, etc), number of cigarettes smoked per day, etc), but others are not. Goals based on improving the ‘quality’ of your life such as improved relationships with your kids, are difficult to quantify so you’ll need to develop your own measurement system so you are able to measure progress against your goal.

Options for measuring these non-quantifiable goals include:
- Relate goal progress to a measurable unit – the easy one here is ‘time’. You may be able to measure your goal base on say the number of hours per week you spend on the goal. For example, a goal focused on improving family relationships may be measured by the amount of quality time per day you spend with the kids.
- Rating or ranking system based on your assessment or ‘feeling’ of goal progress – you may be able to establish a ranking system based on how you actually feel regarding the goal, with say a ranking of 5 being ‘very happy/ satisfied’ and 1 being ‘very unhappy/ dissatisfied’. You may even be able to make these more specific to your goal, for example a ranking of 5 being ‘I feel extremely energetic and healthy’ and 1 being ‘I feel very lethargic and depressed’, for a health related goal.

However you chose to measure your goal, it needs to be a realistic measurement and it needs to be something that you personally see as a measure of progress – for example, you may prefer to measure progress on our example of family relationships by a defined ranking system (based on ‘feeling’) rather than time spent per day with the kids, recognizing that time with the kids can only improve relationships if it is quality time.

Don’t worry if you’re not totally sure how you intend to measure goals like this – to some extent, the measurement system can be refined as you progress towards your goal outcome and as you become more aware of the measurable benefits. Just don’t change the measurement system for the sake of showing progress if there really hasn’t been anyway.

**Putting it all together**
Congratulations! You now have a fully developed goal and all the information you need to put it into action. All you have to do now is document the goal in an easy to follow format – ie, SMARTER goals!
From the goal development page, you’ll see that you have more or less covered all the SMARTER
aspects of the goal....
- S Specific 
  You wrote down your ‘specific’ goal when you completed the sentence “My goal is to ........ “. By linking this to a life aspect and a Big-Picture statement, you also made this goal give you direction, motivation and focus towards what you really want.
- M Measurable 
  You identified a measurement system for your goal as part of your Mind Map. As well as noting HOW you are going to measure your goal (whether it be a real unit of measurement or a ranking type system), also note your ‘starting’ measurement.
- A Action-oriented 
  As part of your Mind Map you identified the steps required to complete your goal – these are the actions that will form the basis of your personal goal
  Action Plan in the next chapter.
- R Reasoned and realistic
  You wrote down your ‘reason’ goal when you completed the sentence “I want to achieve this goal because ........ “. This statement will be the on-going motivation to drive you to achieve this goal. You’ve also read through your goal statement and asked yourself whether or not it is realistic.
- T Time-bound 
  As you identified the steps required to complete your goal, you also identified how long it will take to complete each step and possibly set yourself a deadline.
- E Ethical, Exciting and Enjoyable
  Have you asked yourself these questions relating to your goal?
- R Resourced 
  On your Mind Map you have identified the resources (time, money, support, information, etc) needed for you to achieve your goal. Make sure you include any sacrifices you have to make in here too.

...so it is now time to transfer this onto a SMARTER goal list!

[Activity 5.2 - start]
Go ahead and fully develop your goal, using the Mind Mapping process.
Make sure you consider:
- Your current position in relation to this goal
- Your proposed goal measurement system
- What you need to achieve this goal and what sacrifices you need to make
- Who makes up your support group for this goal and their roles
- What steps are needed to achieve this goal, including estimated timeframes and deadlines

Once you’ve got it all down, stand back and take a look. What’s missing? What are the recurring
ideas? Where are the connections between goal activities?

Once you’re happy with the Mind Map, select one of the SMARTER Goal templates and document your goal, making sure you address all the SMARTER elements of the goal.

When you’ve finished, read it through – this is the crux of the goal setting process and if you don’t believe what you’ve written, well now is the time to go back and look at why. You need to commit to what you have written on the SMARTER Goal template, so ask yourself:
- Am I really committed to undertaking the actions I have prepared?
- Am I really committed to achieving the action items within the timeframe I have set?
- Am I convinced that this is what I really want?
- Am I excited about the outcome from this goal?
- Am I prepared to allocate the resources and make the sacrifices I have identified?
- Am I actually going to do it?

If you answered “YES” to all of these questions, great! Continue to the next chapter. If you aren’t sure or had some “No’s” in there, then you need to go back and look at ‘why’ - there is no point continuing if the goal you’ve developed and documented has a flaw in it.
[Activity 5.2 - start]

Chapter Review:
Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes?
You should now have a fully developed SMARTER Goal that is:
- Specific and well-defined, giving you a clear direction towards what you want.
- Measurable, either by standard units of measurements or a ranking type system.
- Action-orientated, with a set of clear step-by-step actions.
- Reasoned, relevant and meaningful to you.
- Realistic.
- Time-bound, with step-by-step actions having a set timeframe or deadline.
- Ethical, exciting and enjoyable.
- Resourced.

Keep the completed SMARTER Goal template somewhere prominent – next to all the other important outputs from this workbook would be ideal. This is the pinnacle of what you’ve been working towards and should be referred to regularly to ensure you are mentally on track and in tune with all elements of the goal.

Remember that goal-setting is a progressive process with each stage of the process being based on the outcomes from the previous stage, so the end result will only be as good as the early preparation stages.

So make sure you’re truly comfortable with all aspects of your SMARTER Goal – in the next Chapter we’re going to turn this goal into an action plan, which is like your personal set of step-by-step directions to achieving your goal.


# 6. Step 4: Prepare your Personal Action Plan
Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Prepare an Action Plan to achieve your SMARTER Goal
- Explain why your Action Plan needs to be integrated with your day-to-day activities
- Explain why it’s important to be organised
- Start taking action to achieve your goal!

You’re nearly there! This is the last step you need to complete before you can get underway with your goal.

So now that you have a fully developed SMARTER Goal that is Specific, Measurable, Action-orientated, Reasoned, Realistic, Time-bound, Ethical, Exciting, Enjoyable and Resourced, it’s time to turn this into an actionable Action Plan.

Remember that your goals are your target destination and the Action Plan is how you get there. This is the FIRE part of READY-AIM-FIRE. So often people produce fantastic SMARTER goals that just sit on the shelf and of course, nothing happens to make these goals become a success. Goals won’t magically happen just because you’ve written them down. You still need to MAKE them happen, by taking action – FIRE!

## 6.1 Developing your Action Plan
In the SMARTER goals template, you will have entered actions in the “A” column. Depending on your goal and how much detail you included in the SMARTER, these Action Items may be enough for you to progress to Section 6.2.

Not sure? Well, ask yourself the question: “If these Action Items were my only set of instructions to achieve this goal, would I be able to achieve it?”. If your answer is “YES”, well great! Move onto Section 6.2. If your answer is “No”, take the time now to fully develop your Action Plan by expanding on these Action Items so that you have a truly actionable plan to achieve your goals.

Simply do this by taking each Action Item from your completed SMARTER Goal template and list the steps needed for each action item – include as much detail as necessary including the “What”, “When”, “Where”, “Why”, “How” and “Who”.

Depending on the goal, Action Plans could be a daily plan, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly or any- other suitable time frame. For example, a healthy eating and exercise plan may have daily actions if you want to be very specific about your activities, where as a budgeting plan may only have weekly actions, and career development goals may be even longer.

It doesn’t matter which timeframe you adopt – chose the one that best suits the level of control you want to have over the Action Plan. Daily action plans will have the highest level of control.

[Activity 6.1 (if required to expand Action Items) - start]
Take the time now to fully develop your Action Plan by expanding on the Action Items on your
SMARTER Goal page, so that you have a truly actionable plan to achieve your goals. Include as much detail as necessary including the “What”, “When”, “Where”, “Why”, “How” and “Who”.

When you are finished, ask yourself the question: “If these Action Items were my only set of
instructions to achieve this goal, would I be able to achieve it?”.

If your answer is “YES”, well great! Move onto Section 6.2. If your answer is “No”, go back and add to the Action Plan until you are confident that you are able to achieve your goal with the developed Action Plan.
[Activity 6.1 (if required to expand Action Items) - end]


## 6.2 The KEY to Goal Setting Success
The key to achieving your goals is taking action. The key to getting action on your goals is to integrate the goal’s action plan into your day-to-day routine and tasks, and that’s where it’s important to have ‘Planners’. It’s all about getting yourself organised.

‘Planners’ are specifically for listing the action items or steps to achieve your goals, and ‘schedules’ are used to see how the action plan should pan out over the program and to identify any conflicts in resourcing. The schedules will give you a visual representation of effort. For example, if you prepare a yearly schedule, and it shows lots of activity in the first 3 months but not much after that, you either have a short term goal only with lots of mini-tasks or you’ve crammed too much into the early stages of your Action Plan – be realistic about how much you can take on at any one time.

The planners can be used to incorporate your goal setting actions and day-to-day activities into the one memory-jogging list. You can use your own system if you like – you can get pads of To Do lists and daily diary’s from your local stationary supplier, or use the calender/ to-do lists that come with most email servers (of course, these are only useful if you have your computer on all the time and use it regularly, otherwise you might forget to check items off the list).

Find a system that works for you. The key here is to be organised – ‘Owls’ are going to love this, but if you’re an ‘Eagle’ or a ‘Peacock’, you may find it hard to be disciplined enough to stay organised, but it pays off as you start to achieve your goal. You’ll also be more productive and efficient in your day-to-day activities if you’re better organised. ‘Doves’, you’ll be great with the organisation part of this step, but make sure you put your personal goals high on your priority list and don’t fall into the trap of looking after everyone else first.

**Using the Schedules and Planners**
Take a scheduler that covers the duration of your goal (ie yearly, quarterly, etc). List the actions needed to achieve this goal from your SMARTER goal sheet, and draw a line on the schedule starting at the start date and finishing at the end date.

This is intended to be a summary of Action items, so you can wrap some of the steps up together if this is appropriate. Also add any other activities or events coming up that may affect the schedule – this is not a calender of all events, just things that may affect your ability to take action on your goals, for example planned holiday, seasonal work shifts, etc.

How does it look? Too cluttered at the start and not much at the end. Any clusters of activity? This may be OK if the time, effort and level of resourcing to complete those tasks is manageable, but if they all require a lot of effort on your behalf you may be asking for trouble.

Now is the time to smooth out any spikes in activities and fill up any troughs of inactivity to give you a nice steady pace towards achieving your goal. Also make sure you work around any of those non-goal specific events that may otherwise divert your attention from your goal. If you make any changes to the timing or deadlines of any Action Items, make sure you change this on your Action Plan or in the relevant section of the SMARTER goal template, otherwise there will be a conflict between these documents.

Once you’re happy with the spread of activity, you can use one or several of the planners to set daily, weekly or monthly tasks depending on your goal and its specific Action Plan. You may use the daily planner to really keep yourself disciplined in achieving your goals and maintaining organisation in your day-to-day activities, and also use a weekly or monthly planner to allow you look a bit further ahead at what’s coming up for you.

The important thing though, is that if you use say a daily planner, sit down every week with your weekly and monthly planners to prepare your daily action plans for the following week. That way you’ll maintain control and still keep heading in the right direction by using the mid to longer-term planners as your guide to your end result.

Typically, you’ll prepare a schedule once at the start of your goal as a tool for identifying and managing activity spikes and troughs, although you may want to revisit the goal schedule from time to time as goal progress and your life situation changes. Planners should be prepared at the start of the goal, and progressively throughout the goal to ensure full integration with your day-to-day activities and to reflect the dynamic nature of life itself – ie planners need to be flexible, and current.

Some other tips for using the planners include:
- Make sure you add the date to the top of the planner so you always know you are using the current plan. It also helps for future reference.
- Use different colours to indicate your focus for particular blocks of time. Set your own colour scheme for each focus area (for example exercise, family time, time-out, etc) and use these colours throughout all of the planners you’re using so you can pick out focus areas at a glance.
- Include relevant details for the tasks – What? Where? When? Who? How? This will be most detailed for the daily planners, with decreasing level of detail as the planner outlook increases.

Similarly with the ToDo lists:
- Make task descriptions as detailed as necessary for you to achieve them – include contact details, step-by-step instructions, resources needed, etc.
- Prioritise the items as High | Medium | Low priority (or number them in order of priority, with one being the highest).
- Do the High priority items first (or do them in order, starting from number 1)
- Only add the items that you can do in the timeframe – it may only be part of a task. Add the other items onto a Grass-Catcher List or the Weekly | Monthly Planner
- Any items you don’t get done get put on the top of the To Do List on your next planner
- Tick off items once they are complete.

**What is a Grass Catcher List?**
In the TOOLBOX on the website you may have noticed a ‘Grass-Catcher List’. This is intended to catch any stray actions and thoughts that you come across from time to time, but don’t necessarily have a scheduled time in place.

They maybe other ‘goals’ that you think you’d like to achieve at some stage or just practical things you need to do. The point of this list is simply to capture these thoughts so they don’t slip through the cracks of your hectic life.

**Setting Priorities**
We’ve already looked at how to prioritize your goals using:
1. Priority 1: Must Do.
2. Priority 2: Should Do.
3. Priority 3: Nice to Do!

But you also need to prioritise your day-to-day tasks and activities as well as specific action items for your goals, in order to make sure you’re not letting anything slip through the cracks. You will have daily priorities such as taking the kids to school, and you should also have daily goal specific actions – these all need to be prioritized into one seamless set of action items to make sure your day-to-day life doesn’t take precedence over your goals and vice versa.

To prioritize day-to-day activities and goal specific Action Items, try any one of the following systems:
- Must Do | Should Do | Nice to do – as we’ve done before.
- High | Medium | Low priority – similar to the above with different terminology.
- Action ranking system, where you number all action items in the order that you need to do them, from 1 being most important (do this one first) to however many action items there are on your list.

Another popular way of prioritising action items is the Urgent | Important activity matrix originally
developed by time and organisational management guru Stephen Covey. This matrix is based on all tasks being assigned a level of ‘urgency’ and ‘importance’ as illustrated below.

The Urgent | Important Activity Matrix

y Important       | x Urgent
---               | ---
1 Important, but not Urgent | 2 Important and Urgent
3 Not Important, Not Urgent | 4 Not Important but Urgent

1. Important, but not Urgent.
   Planning, research, design, development, creativity, etc.
2. Important and Urgent.
   Emergencies, planned tasks, commitments, meetings, etc.
3. Not Important, Not Urgent.
   Idle gossip/ chat, bludging, couch potato!, etc
4. Not Important but Urgent.
   Interruptions (phone, drop in visitors), trivial tasks, etc.

> Natural instinct to do the ‘urgent’ tasks first (2 e 4)
> Need to shift focus to do the ‘important’ tasks first (1 e 2)

Human nature means that we instinctively act on tasks that are ‘urgent’, whether these tasks are
important or not. That’s OK for the tasks that are also important, but the other ones are not necessarily the best use of your time and effort.

This matrix can also be used to explain why taking action on goals sometimes gets into trouble. Goals are typically derived from dreams and desires, which by their very nature are not ‘urgent’. Goals are however VERY important and their enabling actions need to be elevated in priority over tasks that are not really important.

So as a tool for helping you prioritise your action items, start by identifying which part of the matrix each task belongs in, and then manage them as follows:

Start with tasks (2)

2. Important and Urgent
   DO these tasks NOW! 
   You MUST meet your important commitments and deal with critical issues as they arise.

Then  go to tasks (1)

1. Important, Not Urgent
   PLAN to do these tasks NEXT!
   These ones are critical to goal setting and ultimate success.

Then go to tasks (4)

4. Not Important, but Urgent 
   MANAGE these activities by cutting them short, rejecting requests and avoiding them while doing important tasks.

And last go to tasks (3)

3. Not Important, Not Urgent 
   AVOID these activities and distractions all together.

Most importantly, find a prioritisation system that suits you – prioritising tasks is the key to time
management and organisation and is essential if you have any hope of achieving your goals.

[Activity 6.2 - start]
**Prepare a Schedule for your Overall Goal**
Select a scheduler that covers the duration of your goal (ie yearly, quarterly, etc). List the actions needed to achieve that goal from your SMARTER goal sheet, and draw a line on the schedule starting at the start date and finishing at the end date. Add any other activities or events coming up that may affect the schedule.

How does it look? Any clusters of activity? What level of resourcing/ effort is required during these clusters of activity? Is this achievable? Are there any non-goal activities or events likely to divert your attention from your goal?

Smooth out any spikes in activities and fill up any troughs of inactivity to give a nice steady pace and resource loading. Make any necessary changes to your Action Plan or in the relevant section of the SMARTER goal template to keep the documents consistent.

**Prepare your first set of Planners**
Select a Planner/s with a timeframe that suits your goal and prepare your planners, combining your goal specific Action Plan with your day-to-day activities on the same planner. Chose a short term and medium term planner (eg daily and weekly, or weekly and monthly) and prepare up to 1 month worth of planners at a time.

This is your first set of Planners. As you progress through your goal, prepare successive sets of
planners combining your goal specific Action Plan with your day-to-day activities.
[Activity 6.2 - end]

**How to Manage Procrastination**
Procrastination is simply putting things off - and we’ve all done it at some stage, whether you’re a Dove, Owl, Peacock or Eagle! It doesn’t mean you’re lazy or not productive, it just means you may be focusing on some tasks at the expense of others, or maybe you’re just having some difficulty overcoming the inertia of getting a particular task started.

The question is, “Why?”, and if you know why you’re procrastinating then you are well on the way to being able to overcome it. Your behaviour profile developed in Section 2 will already indicate some causes of procrastination – ‘Eagles’ may procrastinate over seemingly routine or mundane tasks, ‘Peacocks’ may simply lose interest in a task, ‘Owls’ may wait to achieve perfection before starting a task and ‘Doves’ may avoid tasks that take them out of their comfort zone.

It is important to recognize that your particular behaviour profile will have an influence on HOW you take action on particular tasks and which ones you are likely to procrastinate over, but regardless of this there are also some common causes of procrastination:
- There are more enjoyable things to do! Or perhaps you’re just waiting to be in the right frame of mind for launching into action.
- There are other tasks to do that are in your ‘comfort zone’ and therefore easier to do.
- You may find the task a little daunting and not know where to start, particularly if the task is not within your normal skill set – yes, even Eagles can feel overwhelmed by challenging tasks!
- Fear of failure – refer back to Section 1.3.
- Just can’t get started – building up enough momentum to get the ball rolling can take unforeseen effort depending on the task.

You know yourself better than anyone – are you prone to procrastination? Why? Now, be honest with yourself here – understanding whether you are likely to procrastinate on particular types of tasks is vital to overcoming this period of inaction.

So, how do you deal with procrastination?

First of all, you will KNOW WHEN you are procrastinating on a particular task – just monitor your ToDo List or progress against your goal to see the impact of procrastination [goal progress monitoring is discussed in the next chapter]. The important thing is to ask yourself ‘why’ and then ‘how’. For example:
- Motivate yourself by setting yourself a reward for getting it done and an even better reward for getting it done on time. Interestingly, most people feel bad when they procrastinate – that’s your subconscious telling you that you’re focusing on the wrong things. Your subconscious also rewards you for completing a task by the little buzz you get when it’s done – so in a way, completing a task is it’s own reward.
- Remind yourself of the reason you set this goal in the first place – your big-picture, your motivation and your focus. Keep this in the forefront of your mind to motivate you to continue.
- Combining your goal actions with your day-to-day routine action items will help as it will become ‘normal’ for a goal action to be part of your day-to-day routine.
- Break down daunting goals into more manageable pieces so you can get some action under your belt. As you start to achieve results, motivation to continue will naturally follow.
- Enlist the help of a mentor or support group to follow up on your progress.

Better still, when you are preparing your action plan, ask yourself whether each task is the type of task you’re likely to procrastinate on – if it is, make sure you give yourself every opportunity to be able to achieve it by scheduling it clear of other major tasks that may divert your attention.

At the end of the day, there is no magic solution to procrastination – you just have to bite the bullet and get into it.

“Bite the Bullet”
“Just Do It!”
“Don’t put off to tomorrow what you can do today!”

There are numerous clichés you can use to illustrate the point. There are also some great motivational and inspirational posters available in the Internet (Free ones too) – find one that motivates YOU and hang it on your wall where you can see it every day. It’s all about attitude – embrace the power of positive thinking, and know that YOU are the only person who can make this happen!

## 6.3 Other methods of getting organised
The templates provided on the JaiperJAM website will do everything you need from a goal action
planning and scheduling point of view. You can staple or bind them together into a personalised diary that merges your day-to-day life and goal setting action plan into one easy organizer, or just pin them up on your notice board or fridge for easy reference.

If this format doesn’t suit you, you could also try one of the following:
- Prepare your own planners and schedules using standard software (eg MS Excel or Word) – you can then edit these digitally, or print and bind as above
- Use the ToDo functions and calendars available on most email programs – these are particularly good if you use your computer all the time, and you can set them up to give you reminders.
- There are some great traditional diary systems available – many have an annual refill service, so you can bind up last years diary pages and keep for future reference. See the website for more details.
- There are some dedicated goal setting software packages available that help you with the whole goal setting process described in the above chapters (the process is more or less the same) – from brainstorming your life aspect wish-lists, to goal development and action planning. If you purchase one of these packages, make sure it includes the planning aspect with electronic reminders, etc. See the website for more details.

The key is finding something that works for you – and don’t be fooled by the hype from goal setting system sellers, the goal setting process adopted by all of them is more or less the same, and more or less as developed in this workbook. You don’t need to spend a lot of money on goal setting software or systems – everything you need is available in this workbook and supporting tools for free (they may not look as polished, but they do the same thing! Heck, a sticky note will do the job!). But there are other systems available to you, if this one doesn’t quite suit you - check out the Product Reviews on the website.

Chapter Review:
Go back to the Chapter Outcomes at the start of this chapter. Have you achieved all of these outcomes?

You now have a set of actionable tasks integrated with your day-to-day routine – these make up your road map to success so use them to steer you towards your end destination, your goal. Be diligent in referring to your planners and undertaking the tasks on them. Don’t forget to prioritise your actions as these will change as day-to-day life activities and commitments change [be FLEXIBLE], and beware the plight of procrastination – it will stop you in your tracks and waste away all your goal setting efforts.

You need to take Action to achieve your goal – NOW!



# 7. Step 5: Review your Action Plan and Goals
Chapter Outcomes:
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain why it’s so important to monitor and review your goals and progress
- Explain why your goals and action plans are dynamic and must be flexible
- Turn ‘failure’ into valuable lessons for the future

Now that you have a set of actionable planners that integrate your day-to-day with your goal-setting journey, don’t think it ends there. Reviewing goals and your progress towards your goals is critical if you want goal-setting success. This chapter explains why and how.

## 7.1 Why Monitor and Review?
Goal setting is a dynamic process. Over the long term, your vision will change - goals you had when you were a kid were different to those as a teenager because your needs change, and so does your situation in life. You may recall the Australian TV advertisement that surmises success in your 20’s is making out, success in your 30’s is taking a break, success in your 40’s is making money, success in your 50’s is making more money, success in your 60’s is taking a break and success in your 70’s is making out.

So, it is good practice to go through the whole goal setting process (yes, go through the whole thing again) every year or 2 and at least every 5 years, or if your life takes a sudden change in direction – for example, starting a family – to ensure you are always chasing the right ‘Big-Picture’.

You can monitor the current ‘truth’ in your goal-setting journey by periodically reviewing your Life Aspect Mind Map and SWOT analysis – the important thing to ask yourself in this case is “does this still apply to me or has it changed?”. By doing this you will pick up any early signs that your life is wanting to take a different journey to the one you’ve planned, and this is perfectly normal and in fact expected as your life progresses. The key thing is not to see a change in plans as a failure, it’s just a refocusing exercise.

Even short term goals need to be flexible enough to accommodate things that are out of your control (for example, other priorities on your time), or even things that are in your control but you just underestimated during your goal setting exercise (for example, underestimating how long it takes to quit a habit). Don’t worry if your goals don’t go exactly according to your action plan, as long as you’re making progress in the right direction and make sure you update your action plan to suit so that it is still meaningful to you for achieving your goal. Remember the SMARTER components of your goal always need to apply.

## 7.2 Goal Progress Review
Some goals by their very nature take a while to achieve, so it’s important to review your progress from time to time to make sure that you really are progressing and not just going around in circles. Using mini-goals helps a lot as you will be able to measure your progress by the achievement of these mini-goals, but it isn’t always possible to set mini-goals for all goals.

What do you review? Your gut instincts will give you a clue here, but here are some tips:
- Measure your progress: Goals need to be able to be measured so you can monitor progress. How you measure your goal (eg ranking system, actual measure such as weight, etc) should be established at the start of the goal setting process, along with your starting measurement. By determining your current measurement and comparing it with your starting point, you will be able to see whether or not you have progressed towards your goal.
  Does your current measurement indicate that you are on track or ahead/ behind schedule? If you aren’t on track (and particularly if you are behind schedule), you need to identify ‘why’, as this could undermine your whole goal setting and achievement process.
- Is the goal still relevant: Goals are established based on your situation at the time of setting them. Has your situation relevant to this changed significantly? If there has been a significant change, is it still necessary or are you still able to achieve this goal? Is this goal still what you really want to do? Remember, goals MUST be relevant otherwise you won’t have the motivation to achieve them. Remind yourself why this goal is really important to you, and ask whether this is still the case.
- Are you using your Action Plan: Your action plan is your road map to achieving your goal, which is your end destination. If you’re not using your map, how do you expect to get there? Think about how you have set up your action plan and whether there is another method that will suit you better.

Are you achieving the deadlines on your action items – if not, why not? Deadlines are there for a
reason – to keep up momentum! Perhaps your deadlines were unrealistic (don’t worry, this is
common!) or your time has been directed to other more urgent activities – either way, think about why so you can adjust your action plan.

Do you need to alter your action plan/ timeframe? If you said “No” to either of the above, you
need to make an adjustment to your plan. Remember that action plans need to be flexible
enough to allow changes where necessary and to keep the plan’s relevant, but don’t change the
goal posts too often – try to plan more realistically in the first place.

- Resourcing: Is your level of resourcing (money, time, information, support) adequate? Is this holding you back from achieving your goal or do you find that you are really struggling? Don’t spread resources too thinly – extend the deadlines if you have too. Identify any additional resource needs and where/ how you might find them.

- Review your foundations: Review your preparation and planning for this goal from the workbook, including key messages, your big-picture, personality profile, personal SWOT and mind map. Is there anything from this review that rings alarm bells as you review this goal? Are you still on track to achieving your ‘big-picture? Are any of your weaknesses holding you back? Are there any strengths you can draw on to help? Consider these as you review your goal too.

Other questions to ask yourself about your goal include:
- Is this goal easier or harder than expected?
- Can you take on more, or do you need to take smaller steps?
- Overall, are you happy with your progress? If you are, then great! If not, work out why and fix the problem.
- What are you doing well towards this goal? ...and keep doing it!
- What do you need to do better to achieve this goal? ...and do better!
- Are you enjoying this goal, or at least excited about the end result? Reward yourself for achieving mini-goals and milestones to keep you on your journey. Remember, the end result needs to be something you really want.
- Have you been honest and ethical in your progress towards this goal? Your highly moral sub- conscious won’t let you achieve goals if they have unethical components or if you haven’t been honest with yourself. Is this holding you back?

**Monitoring Time Based Goals**
In Section 5.4 we looked at some specific goals that have typical timeframes for completion, such as learning a new skill (1000 hours) and developing a new habit (3-6 weeks). Measuring the actual time spent on the skill or developing the habit is therefore a monitor of progress against time-based goals.

For example, monitoring time spent on learning a new skill can simply be done by preparing a grid of 1000 squares and crossing off the squares each time you spend an hour learning the skill. By the time you’ve crossed off the 1000th square [or hour] you should have a pretty good grasp of the skill. You can also add selected interim milestones to the grid based on what you should have achieved after a certain number of hours, and add scheduled ‘rewards’ along the way to keep you inspired. Personalise the monitor with stickers, motivational phrases, or anything else you think will help you stick to the goal.


## 7.3 Success/ Failure Analysis
As you progress through the goal setting journey, you will have success and you will have some failures too. The important thing is not to give up when you have a failure, but analysis the failure so you can build on that knowledge and improve future goal setting processes.

It’s equally important to analyse your successes, as this analysis may be able to give you a clue as to what really works for you.

So for every goal completed, it is important to review the goal and the process – you’ll go from strength to strength if you do and will be a goal-setting guru in no time!

So what do you analyse? Well, luckily the earlier lessons in this workbook give you all the ammunition for this analysis. Remember we covered:
- Reasons why goal setting fails, including the 7 deadly sins of goal setting
- Behaviour and intelligence profiles and how this may affect your personal goal setting
- Motivational needs
- Getting the big picture
- Determining what you really want
- Personal SWOT analysis
- SMARTER Goal setting and action planning
- Procrastination

Goal success or failure can occur at any of these levels, which is why it is so important to put the right amount of effort into each stage of the process. Remember though that the key to success/ failure analysis is to identify what you did well, what you didn’t do so well and most importantly how you can improve/ what you can do differently next time. And give the failed goal another go if appropriate (you can always try to quit smoking again). Teach yourself how to follow the pattern of success and stop yourself falling into the pattern of failure.

[Activity 7.1 - start]
I’m sure you’ve already achieved some goals and failed at others, even though you may not have
specifically set them as SMARTER goals.

Think about a success and a failure and try the above analysis. What are your main findings? Does this fit in with the concepts discussed in this workbook? Are there any take-away messages to add to your key message list?
...
...
[Activity 7.1 - end]


## 7.5 What do you do once you’ve achieved a goal?
Well first of all, congratulate yourself on a job well done. It doesn’t matter how big or small your goal was, completion of a goal represents a step in the right direction towards your life success! Reward yourself for your efforts with an appropriate treat [not a huge slice of chocolate cake if your goal was to lose weight!] – it sometimes helps to set this reward when setting the initial goal to help with motivation along the way, of course completion of the reward gives you a real buzz which is often a reward in itself!

The important thing is don’t stop here - set a new goal. Perhaps this was just a mini goal you’ve achieved - start the next mini-goal towards your milestone. Or have you achieved a milestone? In which case, go back through your list of goals and develop the next goal to start on. Does your available effort and resources allow you to work on another couple of goals?

Goal setting is a life-long process – your goals will change along the way, but you should always have some. As you become more experienced in the goal setting process, you will feel a lot more confident in setting and working towards multiple and more complex goals. Build on your experiences both good and bad and be the best that you can be and SUCCEED!

Remember, it’s all about you and it’s all up to you – you’re the only one who can set and achieve your goals.

# 8. In Closing...
So, that’s all there is to it! I hope you’ve found this workbook useful in your goal-setting journey. In this workbook we have covered:
- What exactly ‘goal setting’ is and why it’s important to you
- Why the goal setting process often fails and why you may not have succeeded at setting or achieving goals in the past
- How your behaviour profile, natural intelligence and motivational needs will affect your goal setting
- Life Aspects and the ones that are most important to you
- Keeping an eye on the ‘Big-Picture’
- SMARTER goals
- Action Plans that achieve your SMARTER Goals and integrate with your day-to-day activities
- Why you need to monitor and review your goals and progress and how
- How to turn ‘failure’ into valuable lessons for the future

The goal-setting process used in this Workbook is shown in Figure 7 (for those visual/ spatial people!).

More importantly, you should now have a fully developed SMARTER Goal and supporting Action Plan that is:
- Specific and well-defined, giving you a clear direction towards what you want.
- Measurable, either by standard units of measurements or a ranking type system.
- Action-orientated, with a set of clear step-by-step actions.
- Reasoned, relevant and meaningful to you.
- Realistic.
- Time-bound, with step-by-step actions having a set timeframe or deadline.
- Ethical, exciting and enjoyable.
- Resourced.

This workbook has introduced you to a number of different tools from the JaiperJAM TOOLBOX – some of these you’ll think are pretty good, and others may not have helped you so much. The important thing is to pick out the tools and techniques that work for you, including ones you find from other websites, and add these to your goal-setting arsenal.

Some final tips before you go:
- Practice makes perfect – goal setting is a skill, so don’t worry if it takes a couple of goals to get the hang of it
- If at first you don’t succeed, try again! (but learn from your mistakes)
- Know yourself. Keep goal setting personal and meaningful to you – the ‘Why” is more important than the ‘What’
- Put it in writing and don’t forget the action plans.
- Don’t lose sight of the ‘Big-Picture’, but don’t be afraid to shift the goal posts if you have to.
- Enjoy the journey too!

So, be prepared to reap the benefits of your efforts as you take control of your life with goal setting success!
