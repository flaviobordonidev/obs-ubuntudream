# Rompere le convinzioni - Belief Busting

[Da mettere su sezione LIBERARE]

[vedi dropbox / Anthony Robbins and Dean Graziosi - LaunchPad sneak peek / 3b - Belief Busting Workshop with Tony Robbins]

What is a belief? A belief is a feeling of certainty about what something means. A limiting belief can keep you stuck in a life you aren’t passionate about for years, while a positive belief could propel you to the next version of you. 

In this training, you will discover how to destroy the beliefs that are holding you back and how to create the new beliefs will get you to take action on the things you want to do.

What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are.

3 Questions To Uproot Negative Beliefs (Based On “The Work” By Byron Katie)

[Byron Katie ha queste 4 domande:
- Is it true?
- Can you absolutely know it's true?
- How do you react - what happens - when you believe that thought?
- Who would you be without the thought?
_ _
**Is it true?**
	This question can change your life. Be still and ask yourself if the thought you wrote down is true.
**Can you absolutely know it's true?**
	This is another opportunity to open your mind and to go deeper into the unknown, to find the answers that live beneath what we think we know.
**How do you react - what happens - when you believe that thought?**
	With this question, you begin to notice internal cause and effect. You can see that when you believe the thought, there is a disturbance that can range from mild discomfort to fear or panic. What do you feel? How do you treat the person (or the situation) you've written about, how do you treat yourself, when you believe that thought? Make a list, and be specific. 
**Who would you be without the thought?**
	Imagine yourself in the presence of that person (or in that situation), without believing the thought. How would your life be different if you didn't have the ability to even think the stressful thought? How would you feel? Which do you prefer - life with or without the thought? Which feels kinder, more peaceful?]

3 Questions To Uproot Negative Beliefs (Based On “The Work” By Byron Katie)
The only way to keep a belief is not to question it. The more you question a belief, the more you produce doubt. Therefore, to uproot a negative belief, you want to start to take out the “legs” that are backing it up by creating doubt.
When you bump up against a limiting belief, ask yourself these three questions:

1. ==Break the Pattern: Is this true? Could this be a misinterpretation or misperception? 
     Do you have all the possible information necessary to know exactly what this means?==
     
2. ==Get Leverage: What do you feel, experience and become life when you believe this thought?==
   
3. ==Annihilate the Limiting Belief: If this thought didn’t exist, how would you feel, behave and experience life? What would you be like?==


## Turn It Around
Once you uproot your old, negative belief, you can come up with the opposite belief that will empower you and then create new references or “legs” to back it up.

1. ==Say the opposite / antithesis is true.==

2. ==Come up with at least three examples that show this antithesis is true.==


## Eliminiamo vecchie convinzioni limitanti
Now, let’s crush some of your old limiting beliefs...

Identify An Old Limiting Belief
If you had a belief that was getting in the way of you taking action, or a limiting belief about making the progress you want in your life or business, what would it be? 
1. ==What are 1-2 of your most limiting beliefs?==

Examples of limiting beliefs:
• “No one’s going to listen to me.”
• “I have nothing to share.”
• “Technology is too hard.”
• “I’m scared of / not good at selling.”
• “Too many people are already doing it.”
• “I don’t have a following.”
• “I’m afraid of looking silly or failing.”
• “I’m afraid of money or success.”

Identify The Consequences Of That Belief
What has this belief (or these beliefs) destroyed in your life? For each of the limiting beliefs you captured, what has it cost you? What did this belief keep you from doing or trying? What’s it keeping you from experiencing today, in your business or in your life? What are you missing out on? If you don’t change this belief, what’s it ultimately going to cost you in your life?
2. ==First Belief==

3. ==Second Belief==


Create Your New Empowering Belief
Put yourself in state and come up with your new empowering belief. What’s your new belief that will set you free? What’s the opposite of what you used to believe? What’s the belief that would make you more proud, grateful, happy, driven, playful, and that would make life more meaningful? 
4. ==What’s the new belief that would make you step forward?==

Examples
Old Limiting Belief Examples --> New Empowering Belief Examples
- “No one’s going to listen to me.” --> “Power moves to those who serve.”
- “Too many people are already doing it.” --> “The trend is my friend.”
- “Technology is too hard.” --> “Technology makes everything easier. Technology is simplicity.”
- “I’m afraid of looking silly or failing.” --> “There’s No failure; there’s only learning.”
- “I have nothing to share.” --> “My caring is my sharing.”

- “I’m afraid of money or success.” --> “The secret to living is giving”
