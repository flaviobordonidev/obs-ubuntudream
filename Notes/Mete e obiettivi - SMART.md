THE MAIN PROBLEM IN GOAL SETTING AND WHY YOU NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT IT
How many times have you set a goal only to lose focus of it or completely forget about it? If your answer is many times, then you are not alone.

Many people set out to accomplish a goal and then fail to do so. But don’t be discouraged. Goals take time, and in order to successfully attain one, you need to take many things into consideration.

You might be saying—it’s just a goal, what is there to take into consideration? 

Well, there is something called a SMART goal, and this type of goal will help you determine when, if, and how you should work on your goal.

Here is the acronym broken down:
S- Specific
M- Measurable
A- Attainable
R-Realistic
T- Time-Bound



## SPECIFIC 
[What do I want to achieve?]
Is the goal that you want to set specific?

> A specific goal answer the 3 questions "What", "Why" and "How".
> And when answering what the goal is make sure you answer **what you are going to do**. 

- **What** is the goal?
- ==**Why** this or those goals in particular?==
- **How** are you going to go about accomplishing this goal?

It is easier to accomplish a **specific goal** than it is to accomplish a broad goal. Get specific about your goals.

Here are some examples of goals that people often have: 

- “My goal is to lose weight” or 
- “My goal is to start running.” 

These goals are very broad. How much weight do you want to lose? At what rate? How long do you want to run each day?

Let’s think about how we can change these goals to make them more specific:

- “My goal is to lose one pound a week” or
- “My goal is to run a mile every day. 

These are specific goals that also have direction. 

You see when your goal is too broad that it will not be as easy to accomplish, and it will be easy to focus on other things.

Here are some more examples of broad vs specific goals.
Table of GOALS (Broad vs Specific)
| Broad                                      | Specific |
| :---                                       | :---     |
| My goal is to be fluent in a new language. | My goal is to be fluent in Italian in six months. |
| My goal is to save for my next trip. | My goal is to save at least $200 every payday for my Asian trip. |
| My goal is to have more work-life balance. | I aim to finish my urgent tasks before lunch. So, I can exercise and have dinner with my family. |
| My goal is to live a healthy lifestyle. | My goal is to cut down on eating fried and sugar-rich food. I will also jog for an hour daily. |
| My goal is to have an investment portfolio for retirement. | My goal is to invest in real properties which I’ll turn into rental properties for a steady source of income. |



## MEASURABLE 
[How will I know if I reached my goal?]
Is the goal that you want to set measurable?

> A measurable goal is simply **one that you can keep track of**.

If you run a mile, you can record that you ran the mile for that day. If you so happen to skip a day then it will reflect on your records.

You can also track your speed; maybe as you progress running every day, you become faster. Running one mile may take 15 minutes to complete during your first week of running. But as you get the proper pace and stamina, you can be much faster in 2 weeks. 

If losing a certain amount of weight every week is your goal, then that is something that can certainly be measured. A pound per week of weight loss will definitely show the results in 21 weeks!

When you phrase your goal into something that’s measurable, you become more motivated to achieve it. Why? Since it allows you to check how far you are from reaching your goal. Let’s look at the first two examples:

- Running a mile every day and covering that distance much faster as you progress makes your goal more motivating to accomplish.
- Losing one pound a week is definitely a challenge, but it becomes more meaningful when you check how far you’ve come from 8 weeks ago. 

You see, you need to make your goals work for you; not against you.

If losing 50 pounds is a battle, chop your ideal weight into weekly weight-loss goals. This way, you’ll be more motivated to reach it. You can even sort of punish yourself (by having more exercise time) when you’re not being consistent with your goal!

Yes, making your goal measurable does you two things: consistency and clarity. Once you get consistent in pursuing your goals, you’ll see the light at the end of the tunnel more clearly.

Let’s go back to our earlier examples of **specific goals**. Are there ways to make them more measurable?
Table of GOALS (Specific vs Measurable)
| Specific                                   | Measurable |
| :---                                       | :---       |
| My goal is to be fluent in Italian in six months. | To be fluent in Italian in six months, I will devote 3.50 hours daily to studying. |
| My goal is to save at least $200 every payday for my Asian trip. | My goal is to save $100 each week to have a $2,000 travel fund for my Asian trip in five months. |
| I aim to finish my urgent tasks before lunch. So, I can exercise and have dinner with my family. | I’ll complete my urgent tasks in the first 3 hours. After work, I’ll run for 5 kilometers and then have dinner with my family. |
| My goal is to cut down on eating fried and sugar-rich food. I will also jog for an hour daily. | I’ll only eat fried and sugar-rich food once every seven days. I will also jog for an hour daily. |
| My goal is to invest in real properties which I’ll turn into rental properties for a steady source of income. | I aim to invest in two real properties within eight months. In 2 years, I’ll turn them into rental properties. |



## ATTAINABLE 
[How can I accomplish my goal?]
Can your goal actually be attained? 

> Time and finances are the most important considerations when determining if your goal is attainable.

Here are some things to think about as far as attainable goals:

- Do you have enough ==time== to work on this goal?
- Does this goal require you to spend money? If so, do you have the ==finances==?

**Time and finances** are the most important considerations when determining if your goal is attainable. Sometimes your goal may sound good, but you have to determine if you actually can do it right now.

If you aim to run a mile every day, you need to allot time to reach your goal. Or if you plan to lose a pound each week, you have to be willing to sacrifice overeating during holidays or special occasions. So losing weight becomes attainable.

Also, to avoid overwhelm, **set a timeline that’s achievable**. Time is crucial since it needs to be not impossible to meet nor too easy to reach. While setting your goal, recheck if you have enough time to complete it. The last thing you want is to feel beaten up physically and mentally, leading to a loss of motivation.

Going back to our previous examples of measurable goals, try to make these goals attainable.
Let’s go back to our earlier examples of **measurable goals**. Are there ways to make them attainable?
Table of GOALS (Measurable vs Attainable)
| Measurable                                 | Attainable |
| :---                                       | :---       |
| To be fluent in Italian in six months, I will devote 3.50 hours daily to studying. | Back in college, Italian was one of my electives. So I know the basics of the Italian language. |
| My goal is to save $100 each week to have a $2,000 travel fund for my Asian trip in five months. | I’ll meet my savings goal of $2,000 for my Asian trip since I have a stable job and don’t spend much on stuff. |
| I’ll complete my urgent tasks in the first 3 hours. After work, I’ll run for 5 kilometers and then have dinner with my family. | I always come to work on time and plan my day ahead to avoid “surprise deadlines”. |
| I’ll only eat fried and sugar-rich food once every seven days. I will also jog for an hour daily. | I like eating healthy food. But I have to make time to do grocery shopping and cook my meals. |
| I aim to invest in two real properties within eight months. In 2 years, I’ll turn them into rental properties. | I had two years of experience as a real estate agent. So I have an idea of which properties to invest in. |



## REALISTIC 
[Does my goal match my present situation/needs?]
Can you really accomplish this goal?

> Realistic means that you can really accomplish it in the amount of time you determined.

Consider how long it will actually take to accomplish your goal and be realistic about it. Don’t set a goal to do something in a week that you know will probably take some months to accomplish. For instance, trying to lose 20 pounds a week is just not biologically feasible.

Sometimes people set goals that are just unrealistic. For example, it’s unwise to say that you are going to lose 3 pounds a week or run 30 miles a day if you know that you honestly do not have the time or willpower to do so.

The unrealistic goals that we set usually end up being the ones that cause us disappointment. Be true to yourself and realize what you can do. Of course, **push yourself a little but not too much**.

Being realistic in setting your goals also entails **being truthful to yourself**. You have to consider your priorities, needs, and life situation. Often, we set our minds towards something we really like to achieve, but it doesn’t go with our current priorities. 

For example, running a mile every day sounds measurable and achievable. But if you’re finishing a project or if your wife has just given birth, you may have to **recheck and re-align your priorities**. 

==While establishing your goal, ask yourself if now’s the right time to pursue it. Again, go back to your priorities.==
- ==What do you value more at this point? ==
- ==Does your goal match your needs and current life situation?==

Going back to our previous examples of attainable goals, Let's make these goals realistic.
Table of GOALS (Attainable vs Realistic)
| Attainable                                 | Realistic |
| :---                                       | :---      |
| Back in college, Italian was one of my electives. So I know the basics of the Italian language. | I‘ll be fluent in Italian in six months by allotting 3.50 hours daily. I own my time since I’m a freelancer. |
| I’ll meet my savings goal of $2000 for my Asian trip since I have a stable job and don’t spend much on stuff. | Because I’m single, I can save and spend on the things I like. That includes having trips to anywhere I want to go. |
| I always come to work on time and plan my day ahead to avoid “surprise deadlines”. | We’ve just completed our year-end project at work. So, now’s the time to pursue my fitness goals and spend time with my family. |
| I like eating healthy food. But I have to make time to do grocery shopping and cook my meals. | Not eating pastries and ice cream is a challenge but I can deal with it. As for jogging, I’ll just bundle up as it’s cold outside. |
| I had two years of experience as a real estate agent. So I have an idea of which properties to invest in. | I’ve been working for three decades. I’ll use some of my savings to invest in real properties and then borrow from a bank. |



## TIME-BOUND 
[When must I achieve my goal?]
Is your goal “time-bound”? 

> "time-bounds" means to have a time frame or a deadline. In other words: "Colloca una data"

When we leave out time, that’s when we start to **push back and procrastinate**.

Just saying “My goal is to lose 20 lbs” without any kind of deadline gives no sense of urgency.
It’s the same with just stating, “I’ll run a mile every day”. When do you plan to start running? Or when will you run one mile daily?

We need to set a target date whenever we make goals. This fuels up our **drive to reach what we aim for**. When we leave out time, that’s when we start to push back and procrastinate on our goals. It doesn’t spark our desire to achieve our goals.

It’s okay if you don’t want to start immediately. But **be clear on when you plan to start**. Visualize how you see yourself 4 weeks or 6 months from now. [[visualizzazione]]

Going back to our previous examples of realistic goals, Let's make these goals time-bound.
Table of GOALS (Realistic vs Time-Bound)
| Realistic                                 | Time-Bound |
| :---                                      | :---       |
| I‘ll be fluent in Italian in six months by allotting 3.50 hours daily. I own my time since I’m a freelancer. | My goal is to be fluent in Italian in six months. So, I’ll start studying this weekend. |
| Because I’m single, I can save and spend on the things I like. That includes having trips to anywhere I want to go. | To meet my savings goal of $2,000 in 5 months and have my Asian trip, I’ll start to save $200 this cut-off. |
| We’ve just completed our year-end project at work. So now’s the time to pursue my fitness goals and spend time with family. | Beginning Monday, I’ll finish my urgent tasks in the first 3 hours. After work, I’ll exercise and have dinner with my family. |
| Not eating pastries and ice cream is a challenge but I can deal with it. As for jogging, I’ll just bundle up as it’s cold outside. | In a month, I’ll only eat fried and sugar-rich food once every seven days. I’ll also jog for an hour daily starting this weekend. |
| I’ve been working for three decades. I’ll use some of my savings to invest in real properties and then borrow from a bank. | Two weeks from now, I’ll be checking some real properties in the nearby areas. Before August 31st, I must have two real estate. |
