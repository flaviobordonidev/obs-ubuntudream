# 50 Bias Cognitivi

50 Bias Cognitivi to be aware of so you can be the very best version of you.

6 groups:
- Memory --> Energia-Salute
- Social --> Etica-Sociale o Relazione-Famiglia
- Learning --> Impegno-Lavoro
- Belief --> Equilibrio-Interiorità
- Money --> Valore-Denaro
- Politics --> Etica-Sociale

\* Le frasi con asterisco non sono *tecnicamente* dei *bias cognitivi* ma altre importanti forme di *bias*.

## Fundamental Attribution Error
[Belief - Money]
We jufge others on their personality or fundamental character, but we judge ourselves on the situation. 
Eg: 
- Sally is late to class; She's lazy.
- You're late to class; it was a bad morning.

# Self-Serving Bias
[Money - Belief - Social]
Our failures are situational, but our successes are our responsibility,
Eg:
- You won that award due to hard work rather than help or luck.
- Meanwhile, you failed a test because you hadn't gotten enough sleep.

# In-Group Favoritism
[Social - Belief - Politics]
We favor people who are in our in-group as opposed to an out-group.
Eg:
- Francis is in your church, so you like Francis more than Sally.
- Sally is not in your church, so you like Sally less than Francis.

# Bandwagon Effect
[Social - Belief - Politics]
Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them.
Eg:
- Sally believes fidget spineers help her children. Francis does, too.

## Groupthink
[Social - Belief - Politics]
Due to a desire for conformity and harmony in the group, we make irrational decisions, often to minimize confilict.
Eg:
- Sally wants to go get ice-cream.
- Francis wants to shop for T-shirts.
- You suggest getting T-shirts with pictures of ice cream on them.
