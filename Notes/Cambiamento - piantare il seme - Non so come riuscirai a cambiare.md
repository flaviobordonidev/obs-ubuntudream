# Cambiamento - piantare il seme - Non so come riuscirai a cambiare

Years ago, my mentor Milton Erickson, told me a story.

He was teaching a workshop on hypnosis and therapy in the San Francisco area. One of his students, a child psychiatrist, asked Dr. Erickson if he could bring along one of his challenging teenage patients for Erickson to use as a subject.

Erickson agreed, instructing the psychiatrist to bring the boy by late morning on the first day of the workshop.

When the psychiatrist and the boy arrived at the back of the room around 11 a.m., Erickson asked the boy to come to the stage. It was a large room and it took the boy a few minutes to get himself to the stage and seated. All the while Dr. Erickson did not say a thing.

After looking at the boy in silence for a few more minutes, Dr. Erickson mentioned that the boy’s psychiatrist had told him of the boy’s misbehavior at school and at home.

Then Dr. Erickson said, “I really don’t know how you’re going to change yourself.”

They sat in silence for another few minutes and Dr. Erickson stood up and thanked the boy for coming.

The boy’s psychiatrist was surprised by this, assuming that Erickson had assessed the situation and decided that the boy was too resistant and unmotivated to be a workable demonstration case.

But over the next few months, the boy started to improve his behavior quite dramatically.

When the psychiatrist reported these changes to Erickson, Erickson wasn’t surprised. He had [**planted the seeds of change**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/p9u3v6wq3qu9h3m82zmbqhmk3v733/58hvh7hmg5el4qh6/aHR0cHM6Ly9wc3ljaG1hdmVuLnRlYWNoYWJsZS5jb20vcC9mdXR1cmUtcHVsbA==) and presumed the boy would be able to and willing to change.

This was one of the ways that Erickson taught me to use the future rather than the past to create change.
