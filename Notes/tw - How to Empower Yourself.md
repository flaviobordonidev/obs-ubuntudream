How to Empower Yourself
You may be looking for personal power in all the wrong places.
Posted August 19, 2022 |  Reviewed by Devon Frye

Personal power is not merely the ability to do something. You have the power to drive your vehicle into the side of a building but would hardly be powerful if you did so. Personal power is the ability to resist impulse and act in your long-term best interests. It's often enhanced by not doing something.

Social power is getting other people to do your will. It reduces personal power when it contravenes one’s long-term best interests, for example, abusing loved ones. With social power goes responsibility. The exertion of power without responsibility is at the heart of abuse in all its forms.

## Focus
The sense of personal power is a function of focus. When we focus on what we can’t control—the behavior and attitudes of others, chance, the economy, politics—we feel powerless.

Powerlessness makes us feel vulnerable and likely to perceive ego-threat. The activation of anger in mammals is a perception of vulnerability plus threat, plus a sense that the interaction (real or imagined) has minimal risk of annihilation. Attempts to "manage" anger while you feel vulnerable or threatened, that is, while focused on things you can’t control, can only succeed in harm-reduction.

The habitual response to powerlessness is the psychological affliction of our times: blaming.

Blame makes us look for solutions in places we can’t control. Coping with vulnerable feelings through blame of others yields resentment, disrespect, impulsive behavior, intolerance, and external locus of control—the sense that outcomes of our behavior are in the control of others.

Self-empowerment requires that we supplant the habit of blame with a habit of improving.

When we can’t improve situations, we must improve the experience of them. Heavy traffic is a situation we can’t improve while stuck in it. The experience worsens when we blame other drivers, the design of the highway, the synchronization of traffic lights, or ourselves for not leaving sooner or choosing another route.

But if we focus on improving the experience of sitting in traffic, we’ll have ideas like listening to pleasant music or an audio book, making phone calls, or planning how we’ll compensate for being late.

The habit of improving, like all habits, forms through repetition—practice.

## Focus on What You’re For, Not Against
Most people are for fairness but focus on unfairness. Focus on fairness leads to behaviors that promote cooperation, harmony, equality, and morality—values that most people share.

Focus on unfairness leads to exertion of power and retribution, not fairness. It generates fantasies of forcing submission or punishment, which are bound to make you more powerless.

Focus on what you’re for is likely to evoke cooperation in others. Focus on what you’re against invokes antagonism.

## Personal Empowerment
The first step in personal empowerment is answering the following questions.

- What can I do to make my life better? (examples: be more flexible, question my assumptions, uphold my values—be fair, honest, compassionate).
- What do I do that makes my life worse? (examples: blame, devalue others, act impulsively or on temporary feelings).
- What can I do to make my primary relationship better? (examples: be kinder, protective, more compassionate, more supportive, more loving).
- What do I do that makes my primary relationship worse? (examples: criticize, accuse, stonewall, resent).
- What can I do to improve my parenting? (examples: model the behavior and values I want my children to enact, listen to them, enjoy them, help them think of solutions, respect them, make their home secure).
- What do I do to impair my parenting? (examples: blame, punish, shame, frighten, devalue their other parent, model poor emotion regulation and dysfunctional relationship dynamics).
- What can I do to make my work experience better? (examples: focus on my efforts rather than other people’s opinions, find something useful in criticisms, even when they’re mostly false).
- What do I do that makes my work experience worse? (examples: react in kind to the negative behavior of others, contribute to a resentful or hostile environment).

To empower yourself, practice the behaviors you identified that make your life better—and, of course, avoid those that make your life worse.
