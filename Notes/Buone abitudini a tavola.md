# Buone abitudini a tavola


## Cultive o hábito de cozinhar
Além de ser quase uma terapia, o hábito de preparar as próprias refeições é a melhor forma de saber exatamente quais ingredientes estão nas receitas. Desse modo, é possível elaborar opções mais saudáveis, com temperos naturais, leguminosas e verduras, fugindo de ingredientes processados. 


## Prefira porções menores
Manter o nível de glicose equilibrado é essencial para uma boa saúde, por isso, uma dica é comer em menor quantidade e de forma frequente. 


## Evite distrações na hora de comer
Procure não assistir televisão ou ficar na frente do computador enquanto come. Uma alimentação saudável também consiste em mastigar e saborear os alimentos lentamente para garantir a sensação de saciedade.


## Líquidos somente na hora certa
Beber cerca de 2 litros de água por dia é indicado por especialistas, porém, consumir líquidos no momento das refeições é uma prática que deve ser evitada. O ideal é dar um espaço de, no mínimo, meia hora entre a ingestão de líquidos e alimentos. 


## Tenha paciência
Cada organismo trabalha de um modo e cada pessoa tem um ritmo diferente para perder peso ou chegar no objetivo. Tenha resiliência para atingir o resultado pretendido e não saia do foco. 

O importante é manter a flexibilidade, comer de tudo, mas sem exageros, substituindo, por exemplo, doces com açúcar refinado por frutas, farinha branca por integral, gorduras saturadas por opções mais saudáveis e naturais etc.  


## Use smaller plates
Bigger plates mean bigger portions. And that means you eat more. On a related note, if you’re thinking “I’ll just put less food on my plate” … it’s not that simple. The picture below explains why. When you eat a small portion off of a large plate, your mind feels unsatisfied. Meanwhile, the same portion will feel more filling when eaten off of a small plate. The circles in the image below are the same size, but your brain (and stomach) doesn’t view them that way.

![This image shows how small portion sizes can look filling on a small plate, but sparse on a large plate. Knowing this can help with healthy eating.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gmCtnRB1YOefJb79vs_BlTMC8Ye7CBbl8NHN5GzqxazIhz-NEipqhktXLuQDA2u1MYxOf_z3wwJbbhnsEEP8X9iiTba1o7y1X2t_yqBurSwkWuvImz090SSvRBEPklWgZOxj7e-dWugrdlTfqWh55gS2ttqDHoJHfTmzhtAIgJxzpdIApc1NjeazVZ4e)

## Use tall, slender glasses for soft-drinks
Want to drink less alcohol or soda? Use tall, slender glasses instead of short, fat ones.
Take a look at the image below. Is the horizontal or vertical line longer?

![Like the lines in this photo, vertical glasses will look bigger horizontal ones and will therefore naturally help you drink less.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YNGEQcLdscj99n0g0AXmWSlnV54EKKpNaTgselRY6pAgXV2KzayVLt6QlI4PtBJK4MaEBpSGq2loyC3DokVxIl2_7rxYKqsFJpau-34aQhKHRscu7wj2h4egtTMvS5Pe8aPx7nSYH6tKBdKwEPanKJ9eYrAsFM35Im5bFA8NEcM3txHj3ImMBUiUu1gy)
Like the lines in this photo, vertical glasses will look bigger than horizontal ones and will therefore naturally help you drink less.

As it turns out, both lines are the same length, but our brain has a tendency to overestimate vertical lines. In other words, taller drinks look bigger to our eyes than round, horizontal mugs do. And because height makes things look bigger than width, you’ll actually drink less from taller glasses. In fact, you will typically drink about 20% less from a tall, slender glass than you would from a short, fat glass.


## Use plates that have a high contrast color with your food.  

When the color of your plate matches the color of your food, you naturally serve yourself more because your brain has trouble distinguishing the portion size from the plate. Because of this, dark green and dark blue make great plate colors because they contrast with light foods like pasta and potatoes (which means you’re likely to serve less of them), but don’t contrast very much with leafy greens and vegetables (which means you’re likely to put more of them on your plate).
  

## Display healthy foods in a prominent place. 

For example, you could place a bowl of fruits or nuts near the front door or somewhere else that you pass by before you leave the house. When you’re hungry and in a rush, you are more likely to grab the first thing you see.

  

  

## Wrap unhealthy foods in tin foil. Wrap healthy foods in plastic wrap. 

The old saying, “out of sight, out of mind” turns out to have some truth to it. Eating isn’t just a physical event, but also an emotional one. Your mind often determines what it wants to eat based on what your eyes see. Thus, if you hide unhealthy foods by wrapping them up or tucking them away in less prominent places, then you are less likely to eat them.

  

## Keep healthy foods in larger packages and containers, and unhealthy foods in smaller ones. 

Big boxes and containers tend to catch your eye more, take up space in your kitchen and pantry, and otherwise get in your way. As a result, you’re more likely to notice them and eat them. Meanwhile, smaller items can hide in your kitchen for months. (Just take a look at what you have lying around right now. It’s probably small cans and containers.)

Bonus tip: if you buy a large box of something unhealthy, you can re-package it into smaller Ziploc bags or containers, which should make it less likely that you’ll binge and eat a lot at once.  
  

## Inizia i pranzi principali con la verdura

Nel nord europa è un'ottima abitudine quella di iniziare i pasti principali con un piatto di insalata.

Eat more greens.  There isn't a consensus on the best diet, but pretty much everyone agrees on one thing: eat more veggies. You'll be hard-pressed to find a single diet that doesn't think eating more plants is a good idea.

  

## Never Miss Twice. 

I think life is meant to be lived joyfully. I have no desire to judge myself for eating pizza or to feel guilty for drinking a beer. But, I also know that I feel much better when I eat healthy.

In order to balance the two, I have a simple rule that I try to follow: whenever I eat an unhealthy meal, I follow it with a healthy one.

Missing once is fine, but I never want to miss a healthy meal twice. Top performers make mistakes like everyone else, but they get back on track faster than most people. That’s what I try to do with my diet. I don’t worry about having fun and I try to enjoy life, but I also use this simple rule to guide me back toward a healthy diet as quickly as possible.

## Non mangiare se sei stressato

When you get stressed, your brain feels the addictive call of fat and sugar and you’re pulled back to junk food.

Rilassati prima!  
This could include simple breathing techniques or a [short guided meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpsfWkl5L08). Or something more physical like [exercise](http://jamesclear.com/start-working-out) or [making art](http://jamesclear.com/make-more-art).
