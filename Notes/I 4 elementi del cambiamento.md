# I 4 elementi del cambiamento

There are four key elements of change, each of which is
essential in reprogramming your financial blueprint. They are
simple but profoundly powerful.
The first element of change is **awareness**. You can’t change
something unless you know it exists.

The second element of change is **understanding**. By understanding
where your “way of thinking” originates, you can
recognize that it has to come from outside you.

The third element of change is **disassociation**. Once you
realize this way of thinking isn’t you, you can separate yourself
from it and choose in the present whether to keep it or let it
go—based on who you are today, and where you want to be
tomorrow. You can observe this way of thinking and see it for
what it is, a “file” of information that was stored in your mind
a long, long time ago and may not hold any truth or value for
you anymore.

The fourth element of change is **reconditioning**. We will begin
this process in Part II of this book, where we will introduce
you to the mental files that generate wealth.

Steps for Change: Verbal Programming
* AWARENESS: Write down all the statements you heard about money, wealth, and rich people when you were young.
* UNDERSTANDING: Write down how you believe these statements have affected your financial life so far.
* DISASSOCIATION: Can you see that these thoughts represent only what you learned and are not part of your anatomy and not who you are? Can you see that you have a choice in the present moment to be different?
* DECLARATION: Place your hand over your heart and say... “What I heard about money isn’t necessarily true. I choose to adopt new ways of thinking that support my happiness and success.”
  Touch your head and say... “I have a millionaire mind.”

Steps for Change: Modeling
AWARENESS: Consider the ways of being and habits each
of your parents had around money and wealth. Write
down how you may be identical or opposite to either of
them.
UNDERSTANDING: Write down the effect this modeling
has had on your financial life.
DISASSOCIATION: Can you see this way of being is only
what you learned and isn’t you? Can you see you have a
choice in the present moment to be different?
DECLARATION: Place your hand over your heart and say...
“What I modeled around money was their way. I
choose my way.”
Touch your head and say... “I have a millionaire mind!”

Steps for Change: Specific Incidents
Here’s an exercise you can do with your partner. Sit down and discuss the history each of you brings to your thoughts about money—what you have heard when you were young, what was modeled in your family, and any emotional incidents that occurred. Also, find out what money really means to your partner. Is it pleasure or freedom or security or status? This will assist you in identifying each other’s current money blueprint and may help you discover why you might be disagreeing in this arena.

Next, discuss what you want today not as individuals, but as
a partnership. Decide and agree upon your general goals and
attitudes with regard to money and success. Then create a list of these attitudes and actions you both agree to live by and write them down. Post them on the wall, and if ever there’s an issue, gently, very gently, remind each other what you decided together when you were both objective, unemotional, and outside the grip of your old money blueprints.

AWARENESS: Consider a specific emotional incident you experienced around money when you were young.

UNDERSTANDING: Write down how this incident may have affected your current financial life.

DISASSOCIATION: Can you see this way of being is only what you learned and isn’t you? Can you see you have a choice in the present moment to be different?

DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
“I release my nonsupportive money experiences from the past and create a new and rich future.”

Touch your head and say... “I have a millionaire mind!”
