# New Year's resolutions

New Year's resolutions have been a part of human culture for over four millennia. Originating with the Babylonians, who made promises to their gods at the start of each year to earn favor, this practice evolved over time. The Romans continued the tradition, offering resolutions of good conduct to Janus, the god of beginnings and transitions, after whom January is named.

This custom took various forms across different cultures, but the core idea remained the same: the start of a new year as a symbolic moment to set personal goals and make positive changes. This tradition has endured, with people from all over the world setting resolutions for self-improvement via improved health, personal relationships, and career upgrades.

Interestingly, despite its long-standing history, about 92% of modern New Year's resolutions fail. This high failure rate is often attributed to unrealistic goal setting, lack of a solid plan, or waning motivation over time. Yet, this doesn't deter people from making resolutions year after year. Despite a high failure rate, New Year’s resolutions endure, reflecting, I think, an inherent human yearning for “more” … more health, more love, more contribution. This quality in humans is something I adore… and it’s my mission to help others with their “more.” It’s why I say start with narrative. Install the narratives that undergird the behavior associated with the change you seek. New Year's resolutions represent more than just annual promises; they reflect the best in humans. Our resilience. Our hope. Our stayingin-the-game against all odds. Happy New Year.
