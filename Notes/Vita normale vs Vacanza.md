# Vita normale vs Vacanza

## Fleeting thought
In the Land Rover thinking about the daily 5am wake up during like on safari...
...I need a vacantion after I get home.

## Digest

Safari is not a vacation --> (Idea Compass: EAST) What's opposite?
Contrast: "normal" life vs travel
	- travele doesn't mean switching off
	- You might feel more alive while traveling than living (at home)

Shouldn't we fell "alive" the majority of the time?

Are we just walking zombies in everyday life?

(Idea Compass: North (zoom out?!?)): **What do we live for?**

## Atomic Idea Compass

**West & East**
daily routing on safari vs at home

**North**
We live for connection, and it can come from a foreign place (with strangers -> expand later)

**South**
prompt others for unexpected places of connection
